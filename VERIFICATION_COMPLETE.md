## What Was Tested

### 1. Ingestion System
- ✅ Fetched videos from TikTok
- ✅ Downloaded audio
- ✅ Transcribed with Whisper (faster-whisper)
- ✅ Saved transcripts to `/accounts/{username}/transcriptions/`
- ✅ Created index.json for tracking
- ✅ Idempotent: re-running skips processed videos

**Test Account:** beabettermandaily (3 videos)

---

### 2. Topic Extraction
- ✅ Extracted 10 tags per video using KeyBERT
- ✅ Aggregated 30 unique tags across account
- ✅ Categorized account as "Health" (confidence 0.32)
- ✅ Saved to `/accounts/{username}/topics/`

**Command Used:**
```bash
python3 scripts/extract_topics.py --user beabettermandaily
```

---

### 3. Semantic Search
- ✅ Indexed 162 vectors from 3-4 accounts
- ✅ FAISS index created in `data/search/`
- ✅ Search query "meaning" returned 3 relevant results
- ✅ Results include: text, snippet, video_id, username, timestamp, score
- ✅ Provenance links for jumping to context

**Command Used:**
```bash
python3 scripts/search_semantic.py "meaning" --top-k 3
```

**Sample Result:**
```
Score: 0.353
👤 @kwrt_ — 📹 7554449964382965047 — ⏰ 01:03
📝 Snippet: an experience, in the possibility of an experience...
🔗 python scripts/show_transcript.py --video 7554449964382965047 --username kwrt_ --jump 01:03
```

---

### 4. Context Expansion
- ✅ Parsed 24 sentences with timestamps
- ✅ Jumped to 00:10 timestamp
- ✅ Highlighted target sentence with `>>> <<<`
- ✅ Showed 3 sentences before and after (context window)
- ✅ Formatted timestamps as MM:SS

**Command Used:**
```bash
python3 scripts/show_transcript.py --video 7563374738840571167 --username beabettermandaily --jump 00:10 --context 3
```

**Output:**
```
🎯 Context around sentence 2:
⏰ Time: 00:10
--------------------------------------------
    The majority of men are not going to have the patience...
    
>>> And since all men cannot long tolerate freedom, this means that these men will need to adopt an externally imposed structure <<<

    In this way, I think we can consider that marriage is actually useful...
```

```bash
GET http://localhost:8002/
```
✅ Returns API info with endpoint list

#### Semantic Search
```bash
POST http://localhost:8002/api/search/semantic
Body: {"query": "meaning", "top_k": 2}
```
✅ Returns JSON with results array containing:
- text, snippet, video_id, username, timestamp, score, segment_id

#### Transcript with Jump
```bash
GET http://localhost:8002/api/transcript/beabettermandaily/7563374738840571167?jump=00:10&context=2
```
✅ Returns JSON with sentences array and highlighted flag

#### Additional Endpoints
- ✅ `/api/accounts` - List all accounts
- ✅ `/api/accounts/{username}/tags` - Get account tags
- ✅ `/api/accounts/{username}/category` - Get category
- ✅ `/api/search/stats` - Get index statistics

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: Missing Topics for Test Account
**Problem:** beabettermandaily had no topics directory  
**Fix:** Ran topic extraction script  
**Result:** ✅ Fixed - topics now available

### Issue 2: API Port Conflict
**Problem:** Port 8001 occupied by different process  
**Fix:** Restarted API on port 8002  
**Result:** ✅ Fixed - API fully operational

**No other issues found.**
