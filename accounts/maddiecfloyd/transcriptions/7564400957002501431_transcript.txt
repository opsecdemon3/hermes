==================================================

Okay, I want to make this video really quick because I am feeling happy and just, like, I guess  hopeful, like, I know that, like, I know that my life is rendering right now, is what  it feels like, and so, but for a little bit, maybe, I don't know, who knows. But I'm happy  and I'm doing the things I want to do, and being who I want to be, and that's all I really  care about. But I wanted to share this today because somebody left a comment on one of my  videos, and it really made me, like, want to cry, because I had been asking, like, in my heart,  like, for a sign that I deserve connection, because I've been isolated for a very long time,  and I know that that's intentional. And now I'm feeling like, okay, I'm ready for people. I want  people in my life that see me and get me. I just don't know where they are. And this comment said  something along the lines of, like, oh, your friends must be so lucky they get to have conversations  I have not had a real conversation, like, a deep conversation with anyone in probably a year.  No, that's not true. Months. Okay, but it feels like a year. That's, it feels like that.  It is, like, piercing, because all that I actually crave is, like, to really deeply fully  connect with people. But if the people in your own life are so caught up in who they think they need  to be, it's really hard to connect with them. As you, because they're not being them to the fullest.  They don't, but they don't know that. And when you try to bring it to their attention, which there's  no point trying, because it's their journey. But if you try, then they get really uncomfortable.  And so it's this balance of, like, or this question really for me of, like,  how, why am I this way? Like, why did I get made this way and put here in an environment that  doesn't see me? Why did I get made this way? Is basically my question in my real life.  So I'm getting emotional. But I come on here and share it from my heart  and channel things in the way I meant to, because I love it and it gives me energy. And it  shows me a mirror that actually feels real to look into. But it's online.  And I know other people feel this way. I know, deeply now, seeing the whole, like, the little  groups that have an experiment thing and, like, how eager people work for that community.  I know there are other people that are deeply feeling, that have their hearts open,  that are creative, that are passionate, that just want to connect with other humans.  And we are spread out, it seems like. So if you're one of those people,  reach out to me, like genuinely reach out to me and I will make it a priority to talk to you,  because I want that. Anyway, that comment made me emotional.  And I think it's because there was a time when other people around me kind of wear more on my  wavelength and so, and before I had processed and dealt with a lot of inner stuff right, before I  had really done any inner transformative work, a lot of people around me that I could still connect with,  right? Because of that, we could have deep conversations and it was meaningful. And I have  memories of that and that those memories are so charged, positively. And it feels like,  like, I'm just looking into the window of the memory, like, wishing that I could have that again,  and wondering what I've been doing wrong. And I know, in my heart, that I haven't been doing anything  wrong, but at this feeling of, like, I'm alone. What do I do? Sometimes, not all the time,  it's sometimes. And so, just to the person that left that comment, thank you. Because  it showed me that, okay, like, even if nobody in my life is connecting with me on the level I want to,  right now, there are people that would want to. And that means a lot, so thank you. Okay,  I don't know why that wanted to come through. I just, I like to share and be authentic here,  especially since when you share things, when you channel things, when you  tap into the eternal part of you. Sometimes other humans will interpret that to me,  you have something figured out that they don't, and that's just not true. It's just not true.  It never will be. No other human has it figured out. I promise you. We all have our, our stuff,  but that stuff, our dissolves. When we're honest and when we love ourselves,  so this is me loving myself today, sharing this honestly. Even if it just makes one person feel  less alone, I've done my job. I love you so much, I promise, that everything that you are worried  about, it's going too dissolve. It's not actually real, as your mind is making it seem.  As long as you love yourself, as long as you're honest, things are going to work out for you.  They already are. I love you.
