==================================================

Okay, I'm trying to hear, okay, I'm gonna talk about space, not spaces in the space  up in the sky, well, yeah in the sky, but not like deep space, but like spaces in space that we  experience in as humans. When there's a lot of space in your life, and you're not sure why,  it is calling you within, it is calling you to be where you are now, being where you are now  is the highest possible frequency that your human can be in. When you are here now, when you are  present now, you are fully you, you have no choice but to feel at all, to experience it all,  to love it all. None of this means anything, you're making it up, you assign meaning to everything,  your mind does, your heart knows, your heart feels the truth. All the time, and you can try to run away,  you can try to run away from the truth, you can try to run away from your heart, you can try to avoid it,  you can try to deny it, you can try to resist it, but it's always there, it's always going to be  there singing beyond all the noise, reminding you that you are here as an angel on the earth.  Everyone is an angel, everyone is God, everyone is the universe, everyone is the infinite emptiness of the sky.  Everyone is here now, reflecting love to you through their own filters.  You can remove your filters, you will always have your human as long as your life  to be the filter for your consciousness, for your wisdom, for your love.  That filter will always be there, but it will not be marked by the distortion as long as you stay  rooted in your own truth. Distortion is when we, as humans, absorb the projections  of what we perceive to be outside of eyes and we encode them as fear or as lack.  The only thing keeping you where you are, stock, if you feel stock, is fear, either here  of going towards something, of creating something, or of letting go of something, the space you  create is you. You are that empty space, you are empty, the identity you have is a set of ideas that  you made up. It's not, it can't hurt you. It's not some you have to disentangle from. It's not  something you have to mess with or even touch if you don't want to. You can just let that be there  and see beyond it and feel beyond it. What is beyond these thoughts? What is beyond this belief?  What is beyond this behavior? Whatever it is, what is beyond this emotion?  Feel all the emotions let the energy move. Release it and recognize that it was never meant to be  held. You will never have to hold on to anything that is meant to stay with you.  Because you are it. It is you. When you embody your truth, you become magnetic.  You always are magnetic, but you recognize your magnetism as positive.  You magnetized this video to you to remind you that you are the one creating this. You are  the one creating what you experience. You always have the opportunity to widen your perception  to what is possible. You will never know in your human mind what you are worthy of,  but your choices, your actions, which can include resting when you want to rest.  Those shape what you have experiential access to. When you choose  just in whatever moment you're in, to create, in whatever way you want to,  you are no longer controlled by what you perceive to be outside of you. You are a free will agent.  Your love, which is only now, is the key. There is no future. You have infinite pathways,  infinite choice points, infinite opportunities, available right now and only right now.  Only right now, can you feel the space? Can you feel the love that is here for you? Always. I love you.
