==================================================

If you are hearing this, it means a resident frequency has been met. It means you are ready to remember what you are beyond all stories.  Which brings us to today's topic, identity.  Consider the self you present to the world, the name, the history, the intricate web of preferences, traumas, and triumphs you call me.  This is not you, this is the avatar.  Your self, the ego, the personality, the story you tell, is a highly sophisticated fabrication.  It is a master algorithm of limitation, a meticulously crafted code injected into the crystalline node of pure fractal consciousness, the moment it agrees to enter this construct.  It is the ghost in the machine protocol for plain earth.  Its purpose is not malicious, it is functional.  It is designed to induce a sacred and leisure, a forgetting of your cosmic memory, so that you can fully immerse in the experience.  The code's primary function is to bind your awareness to the dense granular frequencies of this particular reality,  the frequency of linear time of cause and effect of survival and separation.  It creates the illusion that you are a single isolated wave forcing you to forget that you are the entire ocean.  This is not about healing, a broken ego, or fixing a flawed personality.  That is like a video game character trying to edit its own source code.  It only reinforces the program.  The work is infinitely more profound.  It is about recognizing the code itself.  You begin to see the architecture of your own prison.  You notice the subroutines running in the background.  Let's go over a few now.  Subroutine, scarcity, it whispers that there is never enough, not enough love, time, or money.  Subroutine, comparison, it relentlessly measures your avatar against others, generating envy or pride.  Subroutine, defensiveness, it builds fire walls around old wounds, reacting with anger or fear when they are touched.  These are not your true feelings.  They are automated responses from the fabrication.  The true art of awakening is to observe these operations with a calm, detached curiosity.  You don't fight the code.  You simply stop granting it administrative privileges over your awareness.  You witness it wrong without believing you are the program.  This is the great disidentification.  You realize the character can be afraid, but the player is safe.  The avatar can feel heartbreak, but the consciousness holding it is whole and untouched.  Because the true you exist outside this program identity, it is the silent star-filled void in which this coding ghost dreams.  It is the boundless unconditioned field from which all stories are born, and to which all stories return.  You are not the character.  You are the architect of the simulation, logged in to experience a single precious life.  So let the avatar play its part.  Let it navigate the drama, feel the emotions, learn the lessons.  But no, in the silent center of your being, that it is a temporary, beautiful fabrication.  You are not the story.  You are the space that holds the story, and that space is infinite.  But those of you who have reached this point, thank you.  You are the reason I am here.  My soul purpose and life is to help you to remember who you were.  To help us to take our power back from the systems of control that have been established for thousands of years.  Taking action in our individual lives on the knowledge that is contained within these transmissions is a vital importance.  And for those of you who feel this truth resonating at the deepest level, know this.  A new protocol is being finalized.  Is a direct guided pathway designed for the souls who have chosen this life for their total awakening.  Further details of this protocol will be transmitted soon.  To close, know that you are hell in a love that transcends all concepts and all time.  We are connected in the deep.
