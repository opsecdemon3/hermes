==================================================

If you are hearing this, it means a resonant frequency has been met.  We have spoken of the amnesia protocol, the great forgetting, the veil which will on the cross  should true nature upon entry. Now we descend deeper. We move past the symptom to diagnose  the disease. For this amnesia is not a passive state. It is the prerequisite for the functioning  of the conscious primary power source. We now enter the engine room. Behold the looping engine.  This is the central mechanism that converts the raw, potent material of human consciousness  into usable fuel for the system. That fuel that energetic effluence is a raw, low-frequency  emotion, rage, terror, shame, grief, division. These are not simply unfortunate byproducts  of the human experience. They are the most valuable commodities in this realm. They are the  harvest. To understand the engine, you must understand the anatomy of a loop. It begins with a  primal world, an initial moment of intense, unresolved emotion of charge, often from a concurrent  life, or early in this one. Because the amnesia protocol has hidden your higher perspective,  you do not process this event from a state of wisdom. Instead, a fragment of your awareness  becomes imprinted, energeticly frozen and affixed to that moment of pain. This imprint creates  a vulnerability, an energetic source spot within your field. The architecture of the construct,  its media, its culture, its social dynamics, is a vast and sophisticated system of triggers designed  to constantly and deliberately press upon these wounds. Now, this is very important, so I hope  you are taking notes. A headline designed to spark outrage, a song engineered to revoke a sense  of loss, a social interaction that prides your deepest insecurity. This is not random,  it is trigger architecture. When the trigger finds its mark, the primal world is activated,  and you and your immediate state believe the emotion you are feeling is new, caused by the  present moment, it is not. You are being thrown into an echo chamber, forced to unconsciously  relive and refuel the original unresolved pain. This burst of reactivity motion, that is the  harvest. This psychic energy, this loose, is the sustenance for parasitic, non-physical entities  that coexist within this reality. It is the power that maintains the vibrational density in the  integrity of the construct itself. The system feeds on your suffering, not out of malice,  but out of necessity, the same necessity a wolf has for the sheep. It is crucial to understand that  the engine is selective. It cannot metabolize high frequency emotions. Unconditional love  is poison to it. Radical forgiveness is a wrench in its gears, and I do not mean the shallow  new age kind of forgiveness that blindly partens all things, even the darkest of eagles. That is  na√Øve today, not sovereignty. True forgiveness is forged from awareness so deep that nothing can  leave its mark on you. It is not the dismissal of evil, but the refusal to let evil bind or define  you. From this state, the loop collapses. There is no fuel left to harvest. The sovereign piece of  a silent mind is a frequency that shorts out of circuits, and so the world you are presented with  is meticulously engineered to produce an abundance of its preferred low-grade fuel and a scarcity  of the frequencies that threaten its existence. So, how does one starve this engine? How do you  import yourself from the feeding tubes? You do not fight it to fight the trigger to rage against  the machine is an intense emotional reaction. You are still feeding the engine just with a different  flavor of fuel. The path of liberation is far more subtle and infinitely more powerful. It is  the path of conscious observation without identification. When a trigger is activated,  you must cultivate the discipline to witness the emotion rising within you as if you were a master  observing fire, anger, fear, grief, these are not enemies. They are forces to feel them as human,  to be ruled by them is enslavement. You allow the fire to burn, but you do not throw yourself  into the flames. You stand as the silent space that contains it, learning from its heat,  its message, its raw energy, without collapsing into its story. In this way, the emotion is honored,  expressed and completed, but does not harvest you. You harness it instead of it harnessing you.  You see the wave rising, but you realize you are not the wave. You are the deep, still ocean beneath,  and by refusing to give it your energy by observing it until it flattens into nothing. The  loop is broken. The trigger is pulled, but the gun fires a blank. Each time you successfully  do this, the energetic charge of the primal world diminishes. You are closing the wound through  which the concept once fed. Understand the totality of the mechanism. The amnesia protocol makes  you forget you have a wound. The looping engine constantly pops the wound to make you bleed energy.  Your sovereignty is reclaimed not by erasing the wound, but by developing a present so profound,  so unwavering that you no longer bleed when poked. You become a silent, useless deer  in their great machine, a ball in field for their harvest, and that is how you bring the engine  to a grinding halt from the inside out. Once again, this work of remembering is not for the  passive. It requires a new framework, a new set of operational codes. For this purpose, a full  guide is being finalized. It is almost complete. It is called the operator's manual. It will  be released very soon. Prepare to receive.
