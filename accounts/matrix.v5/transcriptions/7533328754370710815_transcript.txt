==================================================

If you are hearing this, it means a resonant frequency has been met.  You seek to explore the realms beyond the confines of the physical,  you inquire about astro-projection and loosen-dreaming as if they are mere techniques.  Curiosity is for the adventurous mind. They are far more profound.  They are inherent aspects of your multi-dimensional nature,  abilities suppressed by the imposed limitations of this fabricated consensus.  Understand this, your consciousness is not tethered to the physical form.  This body is a vehicle, a highly sophisticated bioshoot,  for navigating the densities of this specific frequency band.  But your awareness, your true self, exists beyond these molecular structures.  Astro-projection is not leaving your body. It is the conscious shifting of your awareness  to a different aspect of your being. One that is not bound by the laws of this three-dimensional  contract. It is a return to your natural state of non-locality. The occult traditions,  the ancient wisdom keepers. They understood these realms not as separate from reality,  but as integral parts of it, the astro plane is not indistent, a theory or realm.  It interprets this physical dimension entirely. It is the energetic blueprint upon which  your material world is built. It is the realm of thought forms, of emotional energies,  of the lingering echoes of consciousness. To navigate it consciously is to gain insight into  the very fabric of your perceived reality. However, tread with awareness. These realms,  like your physical one, have their currents and their inhabitants. The astro plane is not  an empty void. It is teeming with energies, both sentient and non-sentient, strong to your energetic  signature. Unconscious projection can leave you vulnerable to these influences. Therefore,  the foundation of all conscious out of body exploration must be a state of inner coherence  of purified intention of unwavering sovereignty. Fear acts as a beaten, attracting energies  that resonate with that vibration. To cultivate this unwavering sovereignty,  to tune your own instrument beyond the frequency of fear, you must first master your own resonance.  The most direct path is through this mastery. Most techniques focus on the mind's ability  to visualize. This is a lower harmonic of the true process. The method that follows requires  patience and consistency. It is not a trick. It is the tuning of an instrument. Your own energy  body. This is the resonance method. First is phase one, achieving physical stillness.  Lie down and complete darkness and silence. Fly down your back. Arms at your sides.  Palms facing up do not use a pillow if possible. The goal is to make the body a neutral element.  Begin by bringing your awareness to your feet and consciously release all tension.  Slowly, methodically, move this wave of relaxation up through your entire body.  Angles, calves, knees, thighs, hips, abdomen, chest, arms, neck, face. Until the physical  vessel is completely inert. It must feel like a heavy empty shell. You must forget you  at a body. This phase is complete only when physical sensation is faded from your awareness.  Next is phase two, cultivating the vibrational state. Now you shift your awareness from the physical  to the energetic. Bring your focus to the space within your body. At first, there is only  darkness, remain patient. You are listening for a subtle home, a faint buzzing. If you do not  feel it the first night, do not label this as failure. You are tuning an ancient instrument.  Some strings take longer to resonate. This is the intrinsic frequency of your own energy body,  often called the astral or if there it body. Do not slide to create it. Listen for it.  Feel for it. It may start in your hands feet or head. We perceive the slightest hint  of this vibration. Jetly place your full undivided attention upon it. Like a tuning fork,  your attention will amplify it. Allow this vibration to grow. Let it expand until your entire  being is humming with this internal electric energy. It is a very real physical sensation. Do  not be alarmed. You are simply becoming aware of the vehicle you will use. The final step is  phase three, the sovereign separation. And this is the most critical phase where most fail.  They try to force their way out. This is futile. You cannot exit through effort. You exit through  surrender. Once your entire being is resonating strongly, you must let go of all intent. Your  only task is to hold your awareness within the vibration itself. Then introduce a single  subtle thought, the idea of floating, imagine the lightness of a feather, contemplate the feeling  of rising, do not visualize yourself leaving. Feel the sensation of becoming less dense. At this  point, one of two things will happen. You may feel the vibrations intensify dramatically before you  feel a release or a pop. Your awareness is suddenly free looking down at your physical form or  more subtly. You will simply find that your point of awareness has shifted. You will wake up in  a different state. Often already floating near the ceiling. The key is the absence of struggle.  You are not pushing out of your body. You are allowing your awareness to shift its focus  to the vehicle that is already vibrating at a higher frequency. This exercise practice with  diligence is not just a method for astro-projection. It is a fundamental training in a mastery  of your own consciousness and energy prepared the best of first, the journey will follow.  Once the journey of conscious projection is initiated, its purpose is not tourism,  is investigation. From that non-local state, you are able to perceive the energetic  architecture that underpins this physical reality. You witness firsthand that your consciousness  is not confined to your biology. Your experience of sovereignty that cannot be fully described,  only known. The primary task is to hold your state of calm awareness to observe and to bring  that profound memory that knowing of your boundless nature back into the vessel upon your return.  This integration is what creates lasting transformation. If you've made this far,  thank you. You are the reason I am here. And the reason we are here, as nodes of awareness in this  moment, is to do more than just process information. We are here to shift the field.  Think of each mind that understands this truth as a single powerful turning fork.  When you resonate with this knowledge, you create a clear silence home.  The work is not to gather all the turning force in one room, but for each one to resonate  perfectly in its own place. This is the secret. We are not here to fight the darkness.  We are here each in our own sovereign space to hold a frequency of truth so powerful, so stable,  and so coherent that the chaotic energies of the construct simply find no purchase in our  fields. They are not fought. They are dissolved. Like a shadow in the presence of the sun.  If these transmissions resonate, your part in this work is not to follow an external  path, but to cultivate this frequency within yourself, in your own silence, in your own sovereignty,  hold this coherence. By doing so, you automatically add your light to a collective,  unseen field of awakening. The work is not done by joining, but by becoming, I love you all from  the original frequency. The fair distortion, the fair division, the fair and the dream again.
