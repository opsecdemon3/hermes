==================================================

If you are hearing this, it means a resonant frequency has been met.  You have begun the sacred work of frequency sovereignty.  You have started to clear the static, to starve the looping engine, and to cultivate  the sanctum under inner world.  As the deafening noise of the construct receipts, a new signal once drowned out begins to emerge.  It is faint at first, speaking a language or conditioned mind does not understand.  This is not a flaw, it is a feature.  This new signal is the code of access, the direct data stream from your own, higher intelligence,  your fractal self.  It is the universe speaking to you without the compromised filter of the matrix.  This transmission is designed to attune your awareness to this language.  You will see being a passive listener and become a conscious cryptographer, a decoder  of the sacred language of your own soul.  This code is delivered primarily through 3 channels, to master them is to master the art  of living noses.  The first and most fundamental channel is the language of resonance.  This is your body's compass.  Your logical mind has been programmed and can be deceived.  Your emotions can be triggered and manipulated, but the body in its deepest, secular  wisdom cannot lie.  Truth has a physical signature, it feels like expansion, a calm certainty in your soul  and plexus.  A sudden release of tension didn't know you were holding.  Is it quiet so and yes that resonates through your entire being without thought?  Distortion, falsehood, or manipulation feels like constriction.  A subtle tightening, a feeling of anxiety, a sourness, a sense of offness that the mind  will rush to rationalize away.  Your first and most important discipline is to trust this somatic wisdom above all else.  Your body isn't infallible lie detector.  If you would only learn to honor its subtle signals.  The second channel is the theater of symbols.  This is the language of dreams and synchronicity.  Your higher self does not speak in linear sentences.  It speaks in the rich archetypal language of metaphor.  The dream scape is its canvas, the events of your waking life is its stage.  We become loosely in a dream or when a meaningful coincidence, it repeating number  or a chance encounter is a significant animal crushing your path or rests your attention.  You are being sent a symbolic packet of information.  The areas to seek a universal dictionary for these symbols.  The keys to hold a symbol in your awareness and ask, what does this mean for me?  Feel its personal resonance.  A hawk may mean one thing to one soul and something entirely different to another.  The symbol is a key design to unlock a specific door within your consciousness, meditate upon it, feel it, let its meaning bloom from within you.  The third and most direct channel is that of pure noisess.  This is the silent knowing.  It is the sudden downward of complex information that arise in your awareness fully found.  Without a preceding train of thought, it is the answer to a question you haven't yet asked.  It is the solution to a problem appearing in its totality.  This is a pure form of transmission, a direct data packet from your fractal self by passing all lower filters.  The great challenge of this channel is to trust it, as logical mind will immediately attack it, demanding to know it's origin.  Your discipline here is to receive the knowing with quiet gratitude, act upon it with courage and verifies truth to the regalian shapes.  By trusting these flashes of noisess, you strengthen the channel, and the downloads become clearer and more frequent.  But as you tune these channels, you must become aware of the great deceiver, the primary source of interference, your own egoic mind, the ego of the conditioned personality, is a master of mimicry, and will create false synchronities to justify its desires.  It will generate anxiety and doubt to discredit true noisess.  It will interpret symbols through the lens of its own fears and fanities.  Here is how you discern the signal from the nois, truth, whispers, the ego shouts, truth brings relief, the ego breeds urgency, always, always, check the signal against the first channel, the unwavering compass of physical resonance.  By mastering these channels, by learning to discern the signal from the static, you undergo a fundamental transformation.  You see being a secret of external truths, do-ruse, or saviors, you become your own source, you become the Oracle.  Your life sees us to be a series of reactions to an external world, and becomes a masterful dance of co-creation with the universe, guided by the flawless, real time intelligence of your own.  Totality.  The code is not meant to be broken, is meant to be embodied, you not learn the language, you become the language, you are the language, now discover and live it.
