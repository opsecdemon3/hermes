==================================================

If you are hearing this, it means a resident frequency has been met.  You arrive here believing you are in blank slate.  A fresh page upon which a new life is to be written.  This is the first and most pervasive deception you are subjected to.  It is not a natural consequence of birth.  It is the result of a deliberate, meticulously crafted, energetic process.  Upon each entry into this dense frequency,  a specific and media protocol is initiated.  Think of it as a deep, resonant home that blankets your consciousness.  A vibrational firewall erected between your incarnate awareness and the vast library of your true self.  Its purpose is singular and ruthlessly efficient to ensure the perpetuation of the conflict.  By wiping the conscious memory of who you were, where do you come from?  In the very rules of the game you are playing, it guarantees you are engaged with its lessons  and its traps, as if for the first time, every time.  A player with no memory of the previous games is destined to repeat them.  This protocol erects the reprimary veils of forgetting.  The first veil conceals the memory of your other lives, not just past lives in a linear  sense, but your concurrent expressions across the fractal of your being.  Without this knowledge, you perceive yourself as an isolated event, a singular point of cause and effect.  This fasciers of sense of victimhood and powerlessness, as you cannot see the larger patterns  you were here to resolve, you were convinced you were a singular, lonely note and in truth,  you were the entire symphony.  The second veil conceals your cosmic origin.  It is the veil that convinces you that you are the product of this world,  that your consciousness is a byproduct of your biology.  It makes you forget that you are a sovereign, creator consciousness,  a spark of the uncreated light that chose to project a facet of itself  into this experience. This veil instills a deep existential orphanhood.  A yearning for a home, you cannot consciously remember,  forcing you to seek validation from the very construct that masks it.  The third and most critical veil conceals the fundamental nature of this realm.  It makes you forget that this is a construct, a divine game, a school of alchemy,  a form of energy, depending on your level of perception.  This veil is what makes the illusion feel absolute. It gives weight to the dramas,  gravity to the fears, and finality to the losses.  And awareness that knows it is in a game,  plays differently than one that believes the game is reality itself.  This veil is what makes the stakes feel real,  thereby generating the potent emotional energy upon which the system feeds.  The mechanism of this amnesia is not chemical, it is vibrational,  protocol works by attuning the developing physical vessel your bioshoot  to an extremely narrow band of perception. It locks your awareness into the five senses  in the illusion of linear time. The memories, the knowledge, your history,  it is not erased. It is simply broadcasting on frequencies that your standard issue equipment is  no longer designed to receive. You are living in a library where you have been conditioned to  believe only one book exists. Therefore, the path to liberation, the disillusion of this protocol,  lies in becoming the memory architect of your own being. It is the conscious decision  to retune your own receiver. The key, the master frequency that dissolves the fire wall,  is unwavering presence. The amnesia protocol functions by keeping your consciousness in a  state of perpetual motion, ricocheting between regret for the past and anxiety for the future.  These stakes are the very engine of forgetting. The deep, silent, observant presence of the now  is the one state of being that is outside the protocol's jurisdiction. It is the master key.  From this throne of stillness, the work begins. You learn to listen past the noise of the single  radio station, the fragmented data streams of your greater self do not return as a clear narrative  film. They return as resonance. A sudden wave of inexplicable sadness, a flash of intuitive  knowing, a dream so real it leaves an emotional echo for days. A deep, instinctual mastery  of a skill you've never learned. The memory architect does not chase these fragments. You sit in  your sovereign presence and allow them to surface. You greet them, not with the emotional reaction,  but with calm, dispassionate curiosity. You acknowledge the feeling you think the echo  for returning. You integrate its wisdom and you release its energetic charge. You are not reliving  the trauma. You are reclaiming the power that was fragmented within it. This is the great work  of remembering. It is a deliberate courageous act to rebuilding the bridge between your incarnate  self and your infinite self. You are not a victim of amnesia. You are a dormant, sovereign,  with the inherent capacity to remember everything. To dismantle this protocol is the ultimate  act of defiance. To stand within the dream and remember the dreamer, fully and completely.  This work of remembering is not for the passive. It requires a new framework, a new set of  operational codes. For this purpose, a thing guide is being finalized. It is called the operator's  manual. The transmission is almost complete, prepared to receive. I love you all with a depth beyond  measure.
