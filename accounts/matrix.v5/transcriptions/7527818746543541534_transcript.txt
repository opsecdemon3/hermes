==================================================

If you are hearing this, it is because your resident frequency has been bent.  You may be a last incarnation or at the very least in advanced soul.  Today I'm going to talk about the mind.  The mind is a permeable membrane.  You've been taught to perceive the mind as a fortress,  a private, sovereign space with thought originates.  This is, of course, a foundational solution.  When we peel back the layers and realize the mind is actually not a generator that we see  but a permeable biological membrane can do a specific band of the operating consciousness field.  Your thoughts are not yours.  There are frequencies you are momentarily aligned with,  both in the collective ether by your unique energetic signature.  The enemy was never external control but your own unexamined residents.  Your fears, your attachments, your programming.  They create a magnetic aperture,  drawing in corresponding thought forms that masquerade is your own solution.  To master the mind is not to control your thoughts.  It is to purify your frequency when your internal field is coherent and silent.  The chaotic broadcast of the construct can no longer find a resident surface within you.  You see being a receiver for the static and become a clear channel for pure source consciousness.  I will now provide you all an operational protocol to integrate this truth.  This is a daily practice and exercise, if you will.  One of energetic hygiene designed as several of the hooks of the collective static.  The moment you detected discordant thought,  a loop of fear, a pain of anxiety, a wave of false judgment.  Initiate this protocol sees all external process,  go silent and ask this of the thought form with absolute authority.  Is this frequency native to my core being?  Or is it a foreign broadcast I am simply receiving?  Do not seek an answer in words, feel for the residents.  You will learn to distinguish the signature of your own sovereign consciousness  from the chaotic noise of the construct.  And almost every instance you will recognize the thoughts foreign nature.  Upon this recognition, do not fight it.  Do not engage it, simply declare internally with finality.  This is a foreign broadcast.  I withdraw my consent to receive.  My field is clear.  But performing this sovereignty query throughout your day,  you are not suppressing thought.  You are retraining your being to de-identify from energy that is not yours.  You see being a passive antenna become the conscious master of your own resident field.  Now for scenarios where a false assassination or process is not possible.  A.K., you can't stop what you are doing externally.  Maybe you are at work or something.  Protocol actually does not require physical stillness.  Only a fraction of your internal bandwidth.  It becomes a silent instantaneous command.  The pause is not a halt of action.  But a microsecond of internal focus.  The query is this mind is not spoken in the mind.  But felt as a rapidly energetic check.  Decoration, resonance with drone is executed as a swift, silent fireball protocol.  This is an advanced technique.  With practice the entire sequence of detection, query and rejection occurs in less than a single second.  It becomes an automatic function of your sovereign consciousness.  An energetic immune response that runs in the background without interrupting your external operation.  The practice is the path to this mastery.  We will go deeper into the mind as these transmissions continue.  We are only scratching the surface here.  I tend to bounce back and forth from the deep into the shallow end.  If you haven't already, I highly recommend taking notes during these transmissions.  I do not do this for fun.  I do this to pass the torch to advanced souls and final incarnations.  Ready to potentially leave this plane of existence once or for all.  Or at least have the ability to choose to come back to this place that they want or not.  If you've made it this far, thank you.  You were the reason I am here.  I love you all beyond measure.  Make sure to apply these techniques to your life and I will talk to you soon.
