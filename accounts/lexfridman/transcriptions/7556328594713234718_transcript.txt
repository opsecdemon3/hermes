==================================================

At some point, we realized there are very few websites online that load faster than VK.  Nice. I remember in 2009, I went to Silicon Valley and I met Mark Zuckerberg first time  and some of the other core team members of the early Facebook. Remember Facebook was just  four or five years old then. And everybody kept asking me, how come even here in Silicon Valley  VK loads faster than Facebook? Everything seems to appear instantly on your website. What's the  secret sauce? There was one of the things that made them very curious. And that was always important  to you to have very low latency to make sure the thing loads. Because that's one of the things  telegrams really known for, even non-crapic connections and all that kind of stuff it just  works extremely fast. Everything is fast. As one of the core technological ideas,  we prioritize speed. We think that people can notice the difference even if it's just  like 50 million milliseconds difference. The difference is subconscious. It also allows us not just  to be faster and more responsive. I was so more efficient when it comes to the infrastructure,  the expenses. Because if you code execute faster, it means you need fewer computational resources  to run it. So there is no way you can lose and making things faster and that's why we  have always been very careful when hiring people. I would only hire a person if I'm  ultimately certain is the best option. If you hire somebody who is maybe a little bit distracted  and experienced, you may end up with inefficiencies in your codebase that results in tens of millions  of dollars of losses and think about the responsibility. If we jump to today from the VK days,  token is used by over a billion people. They open it dozens of times every day.  Imagine the app opens with a slide delay say half a second delay, multiplied by dozens of times  by a billion. It's centuries, millennia lost for humanity without any reason other than just being  sloppy.
