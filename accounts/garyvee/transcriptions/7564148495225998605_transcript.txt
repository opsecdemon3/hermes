Title: I don't understand how you can complain while being a human on earth....

==================================================

You will wake up at 70, 80, 90, 100, and you will regret the way you lived your only life.  The math around having a life is 400 trillion to one.  When you understand that math, how can't you live your life?  Who's fucking permission are you looking for?  I am so tired of people stopping because they're uncle, critique them, or their mom made fun of them along the way,  or their girlfriend doesn't think that they can do it.  I bet you take a shot.  Roll up on that hot chicken of bar and ask her out.  Roll up on that good looking dude and ask him for coffee.  Roll up on your business idea and make it happen because being 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and having regrets,  that you didn't swing the bat, is the worst of them all.  Our app bat is in front of us.  Take a swing.
