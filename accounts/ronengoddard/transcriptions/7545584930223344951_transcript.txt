AI will change employment. It will change jobs and there will be stress associated with that.  There's no question about that. It's already happening and it will continue to happen  at a much more rapid pace, exponentially more rapid as the years go on.  Frankly, as the months go on, the challenge and the opportunity for us is to  to note the stress. It's as signal. It's an important signal for us. We don't  want to ignore the stress but to make sure that it doesn't hurt us. There's good  stress and then there's not so good stress. One way to sort this out is to sort  out what you can control. Can I control how I take care of my body? Can I control  how I adapt myself to the new circumstances? And there are an awful lot of things  that each of us can do to take care of ourselves. One of them is called grounding.  It's making sure that we're in touch with what's going on with our  bodies, through breath and motion and just awareness, paying attention to what  our bodies are telling us. They'll tell us whether the stress we're experiencing is  helpful because it's moving us into action or harmful because it's tearing us down  and pulling us into inaction. So, you know, AI is going to take jobs.  It's not going to take your value though and the challenge for all of us is to manage  the stress so that it doesn't impair our health too. Be well.
