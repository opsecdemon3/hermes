==================================================

Truth without care is cruel. But on the other hand, care without truth is avoidance.  Respectful confrontation, a term coined, or at least popularized by my friend Joe Weston,  is embodied truth with compassion and care. It's a revelatory, not conflictatory, if that's a word.  So the practice is simply to name what happened in our usual terms. This happened.  And this is how that fact impacted me. All of that is in our usual, and it's revelatory.  I reveal to you something intimate about me. This is how I felt when that thing happened.  Keep your voice low, keep it steady, and make sure that you're grounded when you communicate this.  You'll be heard better, the more grounded you are.  So then you solicitor response, you say, when I tell you that what happens or make a request,  so please do this, going forward, will you do that and then wait for your response.  So sure we need to tell the truth, but we need to tell it with compassion, and tell it as a revelation of who we are rather than accusation.  Follow here for more conversation about how to be a human.
