==================================================

Every bond, every connection, either deepens or dies just a little bit at the point of confrontation.  See, healthy relationships doesn't mean no confrontation.  Now, in fact, healthy relationships seek out confrontation because confrontation helps to surface truth.  This is not the same as conflict.  Conflict is the striking together.  Confrontation is to open up to each other.  So, avoidance of conflict can sometimes lead to avoidance of confrontation.  And that can make us brittle, fragile, in relationship.  Strong relationships seek out confrontation and then cultivate the skill of repair.  And once you've repaired, there's actually stronger intimacy because a truth has been revealed,  and you've developed a skill for revealing truth, even if it's painful.  And then coming back into into the contact, come back into heart contact with each other.  So conflict may be failure, but confrontation is a seed for growth.  Learn how to tell the difference and then open yourself up to even painful confrontation.  There's growth there if you simply cultivate the need for you to repair and the skill to do that.
