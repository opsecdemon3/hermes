==================================================

If travel taught me one thing, it's this notion of how to be a slippery traveler.  You know, I used to travel as much as 25 times a year for work 15, 20 years ago.  And when you travel that much, you're going to run into a whole bunch of unexpected delays.  Whether delays, missed flights, spending the night in motel sixes and towns you had no idea you would be spending a night in, and so on.  It happens enough.  So that over time I could either be angry all the time or I could learn how to be a slippery traveler.  And imagine a fish or an eel slithering down a small creek that has all sorts of obstacles in the way, but it doesn't care.  It just goes or finds a way to go around those obstacles.  And so with experience, I learned what that meant as a frequent traveler.  How to adjust to this and adjust to that easily and without friction, slippery.  Didn't take long before I realized this is a transferable skill.  A metaphor for my whole life.  If I can become a slippery traveler in my life, then the inevitable detours that life builds in to the experience of living can be navigated in the same way.  Just be a fish or an eel and just slither around it.  Be a slippery traveler.  The great Hindu mystic, Christian emergency was once asked, what's your secret to this calm state of being?  And he said, I don't mind what happens.  A slippery traveler doesn't mind what happens.  So the invitation here is to examine how you respond to these inevitable detours in your life.  And can you make them part of your journey?  And just, oh, okay, here's a rock. Just couldn't go right around that. Oh, here's a twig.  Let me go right around that.  What can you do today to make yourself slippery?
