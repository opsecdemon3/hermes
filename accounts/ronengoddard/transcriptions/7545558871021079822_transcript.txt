==================================================

Where he's about jobs and money in the age of AI are real.  I can't deny that, and you're right to be concerned about them, not just for yourself, but really for millions and perhaps even billions of human beings.  There are very real issues.  These videos I'm recording on this topic are not intended to resolve those issues.  What they are intended to do is invite us all into separating the content of our experience from our sense of well-being and value.  We've been living in this lie that we are only as valuable as what we produce, and AI is stripping us from that.  We can no longer operate under that delusion that we are as valuable as we can produce.  It was never true and now we're beginning to see that it is actually not true.  So AI can change jobs, it can eliminate jobs, it can throw us into financial worry.  And we'll throw many of us into financial worry, but it cannot change our human value.  What it is to be human is untouched by AI, so long as we disconnect our sense of value from our productivity.
