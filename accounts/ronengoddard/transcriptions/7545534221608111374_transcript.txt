If your worth equals your productivity, AI is ending that story.  You see, we've historically identified ourselves with our job titles and with what we do at work.  Listen in on some party conversations. What do you do comes up so often.  But AI increasingly can outperform us in scale, scope, sometimes even quality.  Sometimes it's even better than we are. Not always, I get it.  I use AI a lot, but increasingly that's true.  But see, this lie that's being exposed now of worth being equal to productivity was never true.  It was never true. Now the universe gave us feedback that it was true, but it was never true.  Your value lies in your presence, your capacity to love, your capacity to create.  That was always the truth. See, AI can take your work, but it will never take your value.
