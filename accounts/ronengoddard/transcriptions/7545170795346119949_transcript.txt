Title: Weâ€™ve tied our identity to jobs and output. But that story is ending....

==================================================

AI can take your work. It cannot take your worth. We've built identities around our work. We have job titles. Say what do you do?  Here's my job title about productivity. How valuable are you? I'm this productive and output. That's who we've been. And sure, AI works faster and does some things better.  I admit it. That story is over and it will increasingly become apparent that that story is over. But worth, that story is not over.  Worth is found in presence. Presence in the now, presence in the here and presence in the being.  In retreats that I lead, I see it happen all the time. When people stop identifying as some sort of thing that needs to be proved, they relax.  And their whole body lights up. Their whole being lights up with the life force they came to the retreats to reconnect with in the first place.  Machines can do the work for us. That's increasingly true. But only you can live the being.
