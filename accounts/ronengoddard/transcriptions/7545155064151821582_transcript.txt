==================================================

Out of the box, beautifully set. Life is for the living of it. That's exactly the point.  When we think that life and our worth in that life equals our output, life starts to feel like a map that we have to follow.  But there is no map. There never has been a map. When we return to presence, to living, to love,  that's when we see there never was a map in the first place. Only the miracle of being.
