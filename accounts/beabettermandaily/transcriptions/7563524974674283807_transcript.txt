==================================================

Pain is the gift that nobody wants. But listen to me carefully, it is your most trustworthy  teacher as you navigate through life. Why? Because pain gives you feedback, honest feedback,  with respect to how your behavior interacts with the world and how your mental models align  with reality. Pain will never lie to you. Pain will not try to protect your feelings. Pain  will always tell you the truth in a way that your partner, your parents, your therapist,  your priest, no one will be able to do as directly, consistently, and forthrightly.  You experience pain when you act on mental models that are not aligned with reality. For example,  if you think a stove should be cold when it isn't, and you place your hand on the burner  with that knowledge and expectation, you are going to experience pain. That is, you experience  pain when your knowledge is wrong, which is a nicer way of saying when you're ignorant. This  ignorance could be about the nature of current conditions. It could be about the rules  whereby we extrapolate current conditions into future conditions, and it could be about assumptions  with respect to what conditions should be attended to and what conditions should be ignored.  And the vast majority of this knowledge is gained through experience, which in many cases is a  euphemism for pain. Now, it's also important to understand that pain is not the same thing  as suffering. Suffering is pain plus judgment. The judgment that the pain is somehow unbearable,  wrong, unjust, self-defining, etc. And it can be useful to remember that pain is itself a  construct. Pain is sensation plus judgment. The judgment that the sensation is somehow  aversive, unpleasant, uncomfortable, etc. It's useful to remember that no sensation is universally  experienced as unpleasant. Like I guarantee you, no matter how painful you might consider a sensation  to be, there are people in this world right now who are seeking after that same sensation as a  source of pleasure. In any case, my definition of pain is that it's feedback from the universe  that you are somehow not in line with reality. Now, if you're like me, you've had to learn  your lessons the hard way. And as a therapist, I think that's everyone's right. Like I'm not going  to prevent someone from walking into pain. All counsel them against it, which is light, but I won't  stop them. Everyone has the right to make their own mistakes. And there might actually be  something cowardly and fragile about the person who just takes other people's advice and never fails  on his or her own terms. The lessons that people learn through pain are so deeply integrated into  their being that once they are fully accepted, they never unlearn them. And this is why the highest  wisdom is so often ignored by others. When it comes from someone else, it's kind of held at arms  length until the truth of it that is it's ability to help someone avoid pain in the real world of  actual decisions is tested and integrated.
