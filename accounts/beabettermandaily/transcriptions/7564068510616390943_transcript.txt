==================================================

Ladies and gentlemen, one of the fundamental conditions of happiness is wanting what is possible.  Wanting what is impossible and you sign yourself up for frustration, misery, and despair.  What's more, when you go to the dating pool in general or a specific person in particular,  with an impossible list of criteria, you are much more likely to blame the dating pool in general  or the specific person in particular for your frustration, misery, and despair than your own impossible desires.  So what's the solution?  Want fewer things.  And if possible, get more of your needs met in other relationships.  Sometimes a commitment to a long list of criteria is based on ignorance or delusion.  Like you just don't understand what the market has to offer.  I hate to break it to you, but there are no inexpensive, like front properties.  So sorry.  And really, it should take like an afternoon of searching to figure that out.  So persisting in a belief to the contrary must be based on a willful ignorance and self delusion.  Like people have to actively protect themselves from exposure to disconfirming evidence,  which trust me, people absolutely do.  However, long criteria lists can also be based on anxiety.  The tendency to optimize is actually a form of perfectionism,  and perfectionism has long been known to be a coping strategy for managing anxiety.  It is a futile, ineffective strategy for managing anxiety,  but that doesn't stop anxious people from using it.  A long list of criteria can either be a way of disqualifying a person you wouldn't choose anyway.  If only she did this, I'd marry her in a heartbeat.  Or a socially acceptable way of saying that you are not ready for a relationship.  No mom, it's not that I'm not ready for marriage.  It's that there are no good men around.  However, when good is actually shorthand for 18 different unrelated criteria,  then listen to me, men are not the problem.  Remember, getting three things in a job is functionally impossible.  So how bad do you need the money?  People with trust funds can afford to be picky,  but they're probably not looking for jobs, are they?  What does your bank account look like?  By the same token, there are certain things that you can only get from a sexual relationship.  So how bad do you need those things?  Be honest with yourself, what do your timeline and optionality look like?  How picky can you afford to be?  It's also important to examine why.
