==================================================

The majority of men are not going to have the patience, the discipline, the competence, and the drive to build their own internally extrapolated structures.  And since all men cannot long tolerate freedom, this means that these men will need to adopt an externally imposed structure or risk being annihilated one way or another.  In this way, I think we can consider that marriage is actually useful to a lot of men in precisely the same way that the army is actually useful to a lot of men.  It's kind of strange to equate the two, but they're more similar than we might think.  Consider the army.  The army is a place where young men who might not have any purpose, direction, or self-discipline can learn the value of service, can learn to stand up straight, can learn to be strong, can learn the importance of sacrifice.  They learn to get their lives in order to go to bed at the same time every day and wake up at the same time every day and eat at the same time every day.  And they learn the necessity of pushing through pain and discomfort in the service of an overarching goal.  They learn about honor, teamwork, and tradition.  And they learn valuable skills that can be useful both through their union and potentially through their larger society.  Sounds pretty good, huh?  I guarantee that the army is the best thing that has ever happened to some men.  So, why doesn't everyone enlist?  Well, first and foremost, everyone doesn't enlist because that isn't the whole story about the army.  But no recruiter is going to tell you the whole story ahead of time.  Otherwise, you might make an informed decision, which will absolutely lead to fewer recruits.  However, what is more germane to our present argument?  We can appreciate that everyone doesn't enlist in the army because the army isn't equally beneficial to all men.  And based on the good things the army is presumed to provide, it's easy to deduce the kind of man for whom the army would be most beneficial.  That is, if the army provides purpose, discipline, and competence,  then it's obvious that the army would be most beneficial to purposeless, undisciplined, and incompetent men.  And the more purposeless, undisciplined, and incompetent, the more beneficial the army would be.  However, men naturally vary with respect to these and other dimensions.  If you were to take a man who has already gone through the trouble and expense of becoming purposeful, disciplined, incompetent,  then not only will you find the army less useful, but he may fail to thrive in that environment as well.  This is because the very first thing that would happen, if such a man were to enlist, is that the army would go to work tearing down his internally extrapolated structure.
