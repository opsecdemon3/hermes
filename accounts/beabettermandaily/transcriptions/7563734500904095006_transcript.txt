==================================================

I wish I had better news for you, but it's often the case that you can have the person you want  or you can have the relationship terms you prefer, but you might not be able to have both.  This means that you might not be able to have the terms you prefer with the person you want  or you might not be able to have the person you want with the terms you prefer.  The only people who get both are either very, very attractive or very, very lucky.  Now, this doesn't mean that you can't have a relationship with the person you want,  but that this very often comes at the price of the relationship terms you would prefer.  When this occurs, I call it winning to lose because on the surface, you won!  Hooray! You got the baddie or the alpha, but the costs associated with winning are so high  that the victory is often a pyrrhic one. What you've won is a perpetual defeat.  You lose when you win. And this typically occurs in one of two ways. In the first case,  this can happen when people put the person they want ahead of the terms they prefer.  They have their sights set on one person. They're monomaniacally focused on one specific  individual. I want that man. I have to get that woman. And that is the path of pain. Why?  Well, since people are functionally communicating with their behavior that it's this one person or  nothing or what is basically the same thing, communicating with their behavior that they're  willing to do anything for this one person, they place themselves over the barrel with respect  to the relationship negotiation process. If you take that path, you kind of can't bulk later on  that you aren't enjoying the terms that you prefer. Because if you had made the relationship  conditional to begin with, you might not have succeeded in securing the relationship at all.  On the other hand, it's good practice not to focus on any one person until he or she is  consistently showing up in your life in the way you'd like that person to show up in your life.  Otherwise, you're effectively watering the weeds by reinforcing behavior that you don't prefer.  The issue is, of course, that the person in question might not ever consistently show up  in your life in the way that you would like that person to. So if you don't give up on  that person, you'll have to give up on how you would prefer that person to show up,  because something's got to give, right? However, this can be dangerous. When you put the person  ahead of the terms, you often lose when you win.
