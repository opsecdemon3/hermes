==================================================

The more a woman is attracted to a man, the more smooth and effortless she makes  the courtship process.  She is available, she is flexible, she is happy to be there, et cetera.  On the other hand, when a woman is not very attracted to a given man, but may potentially  see him as a long-term provider, then she tends to make the same process much more difficult.  She is flaky, she is disrespectful, and she presents a number of emotional or behavioral challenges  commonly known as shit tests online, that the man must pass through to access her sexual  opportunity.  Most frustrating of all, she tends to enforce certain relationship rules on these men, and to  punish men for their sexual attraction.  Oh, I never hook up on the first date.  What kind of girl do you think I am?  Are you only looking for sex, et cetera, et cetera, but here's the thing.  These men are already sexually attracted to these women.  Remember, that's why they're there.  And the more he waits, the more he pays, the more whoops he jumps through, the more pot  committed he becomes to his goal of accessing these women sexually.  Now, these women might think, good, I'm not just giving this away, fair enough.  But this attitude comes with one significant liability, namely, the men in question no  longer like these women, but they still want to fuck them.  These men don't like you anymore, because you've made the courtship process so difficult  and expensive and all about you, but they're kind of trapped in a sunken cost fallacy.  They believe the only way to redeem the expense they've already incurred is to keep paying.  Once they actually get laid, they believe that they'll be recompensed for all their emotional  labor.  Now, at this point, I should note that I encourage men in this position to cut their  losses and walk away.  The sunken cost fallacy, after all, is a fallacy for a reason.  Walking away protects the misallocation of future resources.  It doesn't redeem resources already, or anything can really do that.  By the same token, I advise women not to go out with men.  They're not actively interested in sleeping with.  As I've said before, a date is emotional connection plus the opportunity of sex.  If the opportunity is off the table, then the woman is in some manner of bad faith.  She's misguided at best and exploitative at worst.
