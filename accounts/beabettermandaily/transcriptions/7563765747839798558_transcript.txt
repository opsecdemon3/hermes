==================================================

Guys, let's say that you have your sights set on a real baddie.  I've got bad news for you, gentlemen.  It's extremely unlikely that this woman is going to be pursuing you.  It's extremely unlikely that this woman is going to be proactively showing up in your life  in the way that you would like her to.  You'd have to be an underwear model or a professional athlete or a billionaire or all three  or something like that to get her to move to you.  Now, this doesn't necessarily mean that you can't have a relationship with this woman.  You'll probably still have to be very above average for this to work, but it's not technically impossible.  It will only be impossible if you're only above average and expect her to show up as you would prefer.  This means that you will likely have to bait your hook.  You might have to bait your hook with gifts and trips.  You might have to bait your hook with doing a bunch of shit you couldn't care less about.  You might have to bait your hook by being her social media photographer or a couple's content creator.  You might have to bait your hook by playing games with your interest and attention.  You might have to bait your hook by being effusive and persistent and pedestalizing her.  Contrary to popular belief, this can work from time to time,  generally when a woman is getting out of a relationship with someone else who didn't do any of those things.  It's sort of like a palette cleanser, a little refreshment before she attacks the next course.  So there are lots of ways to bait your hook, but you're going to have to do something.  And it's probably something that she wouldn't even consider doing for a less attractive option.  That's just how it is.  The issue is that if it works, you will kind of have to do what works forever in order to maintain the relationship.  And the more the relationship revolves around what the woman wants.  That is, the more frame is seated to secure the relationship, the more expensive that relationship becomes in the long term for the man.  Trying to rest that frame back or to get your own needs met in the relationship will invite instability and conflict because that is not what that woman signed up for.  You lose when you win.
