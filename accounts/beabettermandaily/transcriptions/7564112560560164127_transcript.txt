Jecting women is a skill, men. This is extremely important to learn how to do for several  reasons. First and foremost, you must understand that wanting is free. That is, it costs the  water absolutely nothing to want things. But it costs the giver something to give things. So  there is actually this inherit a symmetry in wanting and giving. Wanting is free, giving is  costly. This is why it's actually a fairly decent interpersonal strategy to want a lot of things.  This is because it's a low cost, low resource strategy that every once in a while will actually  succeed in securing the wanted thing. So it's almost like magic. Through wanting you are sometimes  able to conjure value out of nothing simply by wanting it from the right person. Add to this  the social script that men are taught from boyhood that their role is a provider in a relationship  and you have the perfect conditions for an unconscious reinforcement protocol. On the one hand,  there is little incentive for women to stop wanting things from men because at least every once in a  while the wanting works. So it's maintained through variable rewards schedules. And on the other hand,  men are often punished for not giving women what they want. Usually with emotional punishments  like shame, guilt tripping and withholding. And so the male behavior is maintained through  negative reinforcement. It's a simple trap, but it inclares millions of men. The fact of the matter  is that most people, especially women, will never stop wanting things from you. And the more  successful you become, the more people will want more things from you. And this is certainly true  in the sexual marketplace. The more successful you are with women. That is the more optionality you  have, the more desirable you are, the more attractive you become, more women are going to want  more things from you. Their wanting is free. However, your giving will cost you time, energy,  opportunity, and money. This is why it is very, very important to learn how to reject women.  Whether you like it or not, you have limited quantities of these resources. And if you spend them  as if they were unlimited, you will eventually find yourself depleted and alone. This is because  women generally don't stick around when you have nothing left to give. And among the various resources  spent by givers, the limiting factor, especially the more successful you become, is time. Time  is your most precious resource. Simply wanting time is not sufficient grounds to give it.  I'd want my time too. So just like you're not out there on the street, handing out $100 bills to  everyone who asks, you can't give your time to everyone who requests it. Men must learn to reject women.
