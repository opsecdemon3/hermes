==================================================

Listen to me carefully. No one can see your fucking potential. It is completely invisible to the outside world.  The rest of humanity can only see your results. However, you need to be able to see your own potential.  In order to make it through the trouble and the difficulty and the expense of generating those results,  by competing successfully in the various arenas of life.  And this is why you need to be very honest with yourself about who you are, where your talents lie, and what you can and cannot do.  This will increase the likelihood that you can go all in on races you can actually win,  which will help prevent you from becoming a burned-out also ran.  You will need to believe in yourself because no one else will.  For a very, very long time don't expect support from anybody.  The reason you are not succeeding is not because other people don't believe in you.  No one believes in you.  But that wouldn't matter if you did.
