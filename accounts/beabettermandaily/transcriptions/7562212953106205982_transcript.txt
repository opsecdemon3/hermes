==================================================

Indeed, one of the most difficult things for a woman to tolerate in a relationship is the absence of the motion.  The absence of emotions experienced by most women as punitive as punishing.  This is why if you ever want a certain behavior to disappear, it's better to respond with a neutral, non-reinforcing reaction than to respond with anger or frustration.  The more unemotional the response, the less likely the eliciting behavior will be repeated in the future.  And this is because the absence of emotion is punishing.  And this is where a lot of guys get into trouble, because men, in part due to their temperament and in part due to socialization, are generally not very emotionally expressive.  What's more, a man is an always prepared to engage with a woman more or less on demand.  Sometimes he's tired, sometimes he's preoccupied, sometimes he just wants to be left alone.  In fact, there seem to be some important gender differences in how men and women tend to respond to emotional stressors,  whereas women generally prefer to talk things out in order to feel better, men often prefer to like withdraw into the bat cave.  To solve the problem, men like to go inside to isolate, to incubate, and to resolve the problem internally before emerging with a solution or at least a plan of action.  Of course, it would be very helpful for women to understand that when men are disinterested in interacting with them, it doesn't necessarily mean that they have a problem with them.  They just have a problem. It's occupying their attention, and they don't want to cope with the problem in the same way that women do.  And indeed, it is probably in everyone's best interests if the man and the woman can gently avoid each other for a while while the man goes through his process.  Unfortunately, many women push harder for connection at these times, mostly because they are treating their men the way that they would like to be treated.  If they were in the same situation, and this typically creates an escalating crisis, because when a woman attempts to interact with a man in this state, she is met with a relative absence of emotion.  As the man has begun to withdraw within himself, and this withdrawal will typically be experienced by the woman as punishing, especially if she tends to be more anxious or insecure.  She might begin to worry that something is wrong and now the man has a new problem on his hands that he didn't have before.
