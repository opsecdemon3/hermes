==================================================

Now, the main reason why guys really struggle with rejecting women besides the cultural  scripting mentioned earlier is scarcity mentality.  Most men do not have options with women, and this puts them in a place where it's really  tough for them to reject them, even when the women are obviously not good for them.  It's like if I only had one client, it would be pretty tough for me to say no to that client,  even if his requests deviated from my standard practice, I'd be caught between my values  and my livelihood, which is a pretty difficult place to be.  I might need that client more than that client needs me, which would put me in a disempowered  position relative to that client.  This is why success and optionality can actually make men more virtuous as they are not  pulled to compromise their values for any one person or opportunity.  So a lot of guys just can't fathom saying no to a woman because that woman is like  their only client.  However, let's now assume that you're a successful guy who has increased optionality  with women.  Another reason why guys struggle with rejecting women is that, for lack of a better  word, they fear their emotional response.  They are afraid that saying no will provoke the woman's anger or jeopardize the continuation  of the relationship.  And let's be real, that can certainly happen.  There are a lot of entitled women out there who are used to being daddy's little princess  and have not experienced enough personal rejection from men.  She has yet to develop the emotional callous that would enable her to treat no as information  and not a personal in front.  Well it's possible that a woman may storm out of your life if you don't give her what  she wants, it's probably for the best that she created a vacancy.  A lot of guys fear this negative emotional reaction because of the way that they were brought  up.  Maybe they grew up with mothers or sisters who were tyrannical and emotionally manipulative  and with fathers or brothers who were unwilling or unable to stand up to them.  Evening the first 18 years of their lives in this environment, trains men to believe  from a very young age, that a relationship with a woman is predicated on catering to her  desires or else.  And that is, basically I know you're scrolling, stop scrolling, check out Beagle Live.  It's a place where you hang out with people in real time.  Absolutely not the basis of a very young age, that a relationship with a woman is predicated  on catering to her desires or else.  And that is absolutely not the basis of a healthy or fulfilling relationship for either  party.  However, if a man does not challenge this script, he can find himself in all kinds of really  difficult relationships as an adult.  So you need to be able to reject women in order to safeguard your limited resources.
