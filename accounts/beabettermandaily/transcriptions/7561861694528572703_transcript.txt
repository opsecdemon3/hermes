==================================================

The significance of the emotional dimension over and above the sexual act.  Let's be clear.  Very few people like the idea of their partners having sex with someone else.  And very few people like the idea of their partners becoming emotionally entwined with a third party.  Both of these are common reasons for conflict and divorce.  That's it.  It's also pretty clear from the data that men care much more about sexual infidelity and women care much more about emotional infidelity.  For example, if both groups are forced to choose between a scenario in which their partner enters into a chased,  but emotionally intimate relationship with a third party and one in which their partner enters into a sexual relationship,  devoid of emotion, men are more likely to prefer the first option, and women are more likely to prefer the second.  I believe the study appears and David Buses is the evolution of desire.  Sexual infidelity is very difficult if not impossible for some men to overcome,  whereas women tend to wrinkle if a man gives preferential treatment to another woman,  even if nothing physical occurs.  And we see this difference in attitude reflected in how people try to justify their infidelity.  When men get caught cheating, what's the first thing that comes out of their mouths?  It didn't mean anything.  It was just sex.  And the reason they say this is, well, one, it's often true.  But mentalize more so this might be an accurate reflection of their experience.
