==================================================

If you choose to think that you are worthless and incompetent and that nothing ever goes your way,  you are going to feel depressed. If you choose to think that you are a perpetual victim of  betrayal and injustice, you are going to feel angry. If you choose to think that other people  have good things that you could never hope to earn or achieve, you are going to feel envious,  et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And it's not possible to feel happy if you simultaneously  feel depressed or angry or envious. Like those two states cannot coexist at the same time. And this  means that in order to feel happy, you cannot allow yourself to feel certain emotions,  antithetical to that experience. In order not to feel those emotions, you cannot allow yourself  to think in certain ways. Certain thoughts, certain beliefs, pollute people's minds. They like  irradiate the soil making it impossible for happiness to grow. If you follow my reasoning,  then you inevitably come to the conclusion that in order to be happy, you may need to change  how you think. Not just what you think, certain thoughts very clearly are just not your friends,  and may need to be forcefully resisted using tactics like the block and replace technique.  No, changing what you think is just the first step. Ultimately, the goal is to change  how you think, as this will make happiness both more attainable and more sustainable.  Two important ways to do this are by changing your attention and by changing your language. Both  attention and language are habits. We don't usually think of these things as habits, as tendencies  that we practice and rehearse, but they are. Unfortunately, everyone's habits of attention and  language form before they are consciously aware of forming them. Some of us look out and cultivate  good habits from the get-go, but the vast majority of us do not. And our habits must be consciously  and intentionally reprogrammed in adulthood.
