==================================================

If you really want something in life, your goal will almost certainly not be fully understood and supported and may even be criticized and actively opposed by the people around you, your friends, your family, your girlfriend, your co-workers, etc.  If you allow these people who do not share your dream, and who therefore will not bear the weight of regret, should it go unfulfilled to talk you out of what you really want, then you deserve it.  Everything in this world has a cost.  And if, for whatever reason, you are unable or unwilling to pay it, then the good and question remains closed.  And one of the most common costs we pay in the pursuit of our dreams is the support and approval of those close to us.  To achieve your dreams, you have to be willing to say, go fuck yourself.  And this means for going the support approval of an understanding of those who do not share your vision.  This is true even at the highest levels of reality, like some Zen texts maintain that even should you encounter the Buddha on your path?  You must be willing to strike him down if necessary.  The willingness when appropriate to move past your parents, your teachers, your gurus, your idea of God himself will get you very far in life, like that's how you make real progress.  Failure to cultivate this attitude sufficiently means effectively that you're not going to rock the boat.  You're going to prioritize other people's attitudes and opinions over your own goals and dreams.  This is probably not going to end well for you, and it also won't make those other people happy to boot.  Like you could spend your whole life doing exactly what other people want you to do, and those people could still not love or respect you.  That guy's got no spine, don't think he's ever thought for himself, et cetera, et cetera.  But there's another side of this story.  What while it is very important to cultivate a go fuck yourself attitude in order to get what you want in life,  it might be even more important to cultivate a go fuck myself attitude in order to realize your dreams.
