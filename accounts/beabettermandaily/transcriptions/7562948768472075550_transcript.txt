That women are the gatekeepers of sex, and that men are the gatekeepers of commitment.  And second, that in the contemporary sexual marketplace, sex precedes commitment.  People might gripe about this second observation, but it's probably not going anywhere anytime soon.  This is because, economically, it would be very difficult for a woman in today's day and age  to demand commitment prior to sex. Like, you can't charge for a product that your  competition is giving away for free. You're not going to get it very far with that business  strategy. In any case, since sex now precedes commitment, the fledgling couple comes up against  the woman's gatekeeping first. That is, men have to get through women's gatekeeping  before women have to get through men's. And whichever party is currently trying to get through  the other's gate is reasonably and justifiably going to be making the lion's share of the  effort. For example, in the conventional conceptualization of courtship, the man approaches the woman.  So he assumes a disproportionate amount of the risk. He plans and pays for the dates. So he assumes  a disproportionate amount of the costs and the man initiates and conducts the seduction. So he assumes  a disproportionate amount of the effort here as well. In the lead up to sex, women can kind of expect  to just sort of go along for the ride if they want to. She doesn't have to do much at this stage  of the game, except decide whether she wants to allow the guy access to her sexually.  However, this is also true when it comes to top-tier men who no longer date conventionally.  That is, these men have had to expend considerable effort. Sometimes over the course of decades  to become sufficiently attractive to women that they no longer need to date like the average  Joe. These guys have physics and or power and or fame and or wealth and or success broadly defined.  And again, few women seem to have a problem with men putting in the effort to become more attractive  options for them. In fact, women commonly complain when men deviate from this template  that is when he doesn't make an effort to plan dates or when he asks to split the bill or when  he waits for the woman to initiate. And God help him if he isn't handsome or powerful or famous  or wealthier successful or attractive. Few men complain when men make the effort to be attractive  and when men make more of an effort in the courtship process. They don't mind it when men take  the initiative and pay for dates and sweep her off her feet, etc. Indeed, most men have to  expend a considerable amount of effort. Both before and after the woman shows up to get her to  open her gate and initiate a sexual relationship with him. And again, I hear no complaints from  women about any of this. But here's the thing. Once sex occurs, the balance of power shifts  significantly in the context of that relationship. Women have more power before sex happens because  she controls what he wants, but men have more power after sex happens because he now controls what  she wants. Once sex happens, it's the man's opportunity to act as a gatekeeper.  And he can't be expected to hand over commitment to any woman who wants it,  any more than she can be expected to hand over sex to any man who wants that. And this means that  the onus of effort reasonably and justifiably shifts to the woman.
