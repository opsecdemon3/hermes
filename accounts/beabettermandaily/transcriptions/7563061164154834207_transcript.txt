==================================================

One of the main reasons why women get ghosted after sex is because they do not understand  that the owners of effort has shifted unto them.  They expect that the man is going to keep making the same level of effort after he gets  what he wants.  And that's about as true as expecting that a woman is going to keep making the same level  of effort after she gets what she wants.  Just ask any married man who is more attractive, his wife or his girlfriend who does he have  sex with more often, his wife or his girlfriend, etc.  And why is this the case?  Because it is human fucking nature.  People work harder before getting what they want and they do after they get it.  If a woman wants a committed relationship with a man, she has slept with, that's on her.  She has to make an effort to get that commitment, just like the man had to make an  effort to get that sex while this is unequal, it is fair.  These days, we hear a lot about a woman's emotional labor in the context of their relationships.  That is all the effort.  The woman pours into her relationship to keep her man and maintain his commitment.  But what women have to understand is that everything that a man did before sex was emotional  labor for him.  That was a emotional labor for the man to be charming when he didn't feel like it.  To plan dates around your tastes and preferences instead of his own, to listen to your  stories when you may actually not be very interesting, to put in the effort to stimulate  an excite and arouser emotions and he might have done all these things even when he didn't  feel like doing so.  Why?  Because if he didn't, he wouldn't attain the outcome he hoped for and no one would have  any sympathy for him in this case.  By the same token, women should expect to perform emotional labor to keep their relationships.  They might have to support their boyfriends or husbands, even when they don't feel  like it.  They may have to maintain their physical appearance to keep up their boyfriends or husbands  attraction, even when they don't feel like it.  They may have to suppress their own needs and emotions, even when they don't feel like  it.  They may have to make their boyfriends or husbands feel useful and respected and loved.  Even when they don't feel like it, because trust me, the men did the same thing to  get you.  If they weren't willing to perform that emotional labor, they wouldn't have gotten  laid, there would be no relationship and you wouldn't be with them today.  That's the other side of the coin, so no complaining.  Ultimately though, this isn't about men or women.  The labor, the work, the effort, always falls on the person who is trying to get through  the gate.  It's an offensive tactic, not a defensive one.  Defends doesn't require a lot of effort, just saying no, demand more, raise your standards.  Defends can kind of sit back and wait, not true for offense.  When you're on offense, you have to go out and make something happen.  You cannot wait for the world to just dump it into your lap.  This is because, as I've said before, the universe lives closed.  That is, the default answer to any question is no.
