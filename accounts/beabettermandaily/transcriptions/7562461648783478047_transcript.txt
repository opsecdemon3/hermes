==================================================

Women get ghosted after sex when they make it getting the sex so difficult, painful or expensive  that men no longer think it's worth it to engage with them again.  But here's the thing. This phenomenon still occurs in the context of relationships where the woman is  very attracted to the man and sex occurs fairly quickly. That is, the man undergoes the same  unconscious calculus to determine the transacted value of that sexual opportunity for him.  It's just that these men are anchored at a different price point. That is, when men are  attractive and high value, they routinely engage with attracted women for sexual relationships.  So they are used to getting things fairly cheaply. And this means that even slide increases in  incurred costs may be detrimental to the woman's long-term prospects. You can charge more from  people who are used to paying more. Not so from people who are used to paying less.  And that's why I argue that a woman's best bet is to offer the richest,  creamiest milk she can, high good times, with as little difficulty or friction as she can  muster. Low hassle. These women do not get ghosted. And remember ladies, the more attractive  the man, the lower the margin of error here.
