==================================================

Kindness does not attract.  It doesn't. Women will swear up and down that they're attracted to kindness but it's just not true.  No one sees kindness and gets physically aroused.  Like no man sees kindness and gets hard and no woman sees kindness and gets wet.  In fact, it feels disrespectful to sexualized kindness in that way, doesn't it?  But trust me, if kindness attracted suitors, then mother Teresa would have been surrounded by thirsty people, not hungry people.  You understand?  kindness doesn't attract.  It's a moving and a nobling quality for someone to possess, but it's not good bait.  Buddies and boats are much better bait.  That's just the way it is.  My point is that it really really helps your chances in the sexual marketplace when you make your peace with these realities.  You have to bait your hook with something, and your bait is largely determined by the fish you're trying to catch.  If you don't want to be taken advantage of, then either strive to bring in a bigger haul or qualify your bait with other aspects of your lifestyle and personality.  However, in either case, you've got to play to your strengths.  People will click their tongues when you do, but trust me, the alternatives aren't any better.
