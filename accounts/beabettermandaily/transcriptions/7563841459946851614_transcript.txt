==================================================

Well, all I want is a rich handsome loyal man who spoils me, but knows how to stand up  to my nonsense, who is this comfortable staying in and watching Netflix as he is going  out on the town, who is spontaneous and willing to take trips at a moment's notice, but  who makes me feel safe and protected in his arms because he's so reliable. Someone who is my rock,  but who's always down to rock my world, my partner and crime, my better half, my missing piece.  Well, all I want is a woman who can be my partner, my intellectual equal. Of course,  she needs to be attractive. That goes without saying, someone who can meet me sexually,  but who isn't too harsh about it? Well, have a small family on a ranch, so it would be great  if she loves kids and knows how to slaughter a pig, while remotely running a seven-figure  company in our spare time. We'll continue to push ourselves to grow and learn and explore,  but we'll also never forget our relationship is based on a foundation of shared values and mutual  friendship. Bonus points if she's into rock climbing and call a duty. Guys and gals, does this  sound familiar? If so, this is why you suck at dating. This is why you're single and lonely. This  is why you're paired up in unfulfilling, conflictual relationships. You want to, god damn much,  you want too much. All I want and then you rattle off 20 independent and often mutually exclusive  criteria. Is it really too much to ask that a man? Yeah. Yeah, it really is. Well, why is it so  hard to find a girl? Because you want a fucking unicorn, man, and newsflash, unicorns do not exist.
