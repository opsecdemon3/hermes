==================================================

There is no statistically significant difference in reported relationships at his faction  between men who cheat and men who don't.  This means that the philanderers were just as happy or unhappy with their primary relationships  as the men who stayed loyal.  On the other hand, there is a substantial and statistically significant difference in reported  relationships at his faction between women who cheat and women who don't.  That is, the women who cheat report significantly higher rates of relationship dissatisfaction  in their primary relationships.  To put it another way, women who are satisfied with their relationships are much less likely  to be disloyal, though they still can be.  This finding by itself is interesting, but it also suggests that men and women tend to have  different motivations when they cheat.  Most notably men don't seem to cheat in order to replace their partners or to get needs or  desires met outside of their primary relationship.  If they did, we would likely see differences in relationships at his faction between  cheaters and non-cheaters, right?  On the whole, I think most of the men who cheat do so because they have the opportunity  to do so and be believed they can get away with it.  In fact, they tend to see the infidelity as a sexual outlet that has nothing to do with their primary  relationship.  I have talked to many, many men who have told me, Orion, I love my wife, I would never leave  her, she means the world to me, and I fuck other women.  To these men, these two statements, I love my wife and I fuck other women have nothing to do  with one another.  He does not consider them contradictory.  It's like they live in two different parts of his being.  We can call this compartmentalization, and I think it's a big part of why men and women cheat  for different reasons.  For better or worse, men seem to be better at compartmentalization than women are.  What is the biggest female complaint about men in relationships?  He's emotionally unavailable, right?  This is shorthand for I couldn't access certain parts of his emotionality.  She's not saying the man's emotions are non-existent, she's saying she couldn't get to them,  which suggests that they have been compartmentalized into other dynamics or relationships.  And it's this compartmentalization that is directly responsible for the belief that he can  love one woman and fuck another.  On the other hand, the significantly higher rates of reported relationship deaths  satisfaction in women who cheat suggest that they cheat in order to satisfy needs and desires  that go unmet in the primary relationship.  And we see this born out in the cultural double standard around marital infidelity, namely men  cheat because they are heartless cats. Women cheat because their men weren't treating them right.  And a woman who feels emotionally justified in her behavior will have about as much  compunction about cheating as a man who has successfully compartmentalized the emotion out of the  affair. In any case, female infidelity is a much sure sign of dysfunction in the primary  relationship than his male infidelity. And in many cases, consciously or not, female cheating is  designed to catalyze and end to a relationship that has no longer become tenable.  And if she can do this, while simultaneously securing a potentially more rewarding relationship  in one fell swoop, then she has managed to kill two birds with one stone.
