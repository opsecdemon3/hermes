==================================================

Listen to me. A person who is unhappy and unsuccessful is not wise. A person who is anxious  or depressed is not wise. A person who is arrogant or victimizing or envious or irritable  is not wise. Maybe they have a little knowledge, but as they say a little knowledge can be a  dangerous thing. Internal states like these are the most reliable signs that a person is still  not in real alignment with reality to some extent. And you know what? That's okay. I haven't  learned all of my lessons once and for all either. We're all works in progress, but the trick  is to get better at learning those lessons sooner and with fewer repetitions so that we can  all of us walk more and more on the path of light and receive more of our instruction from that  truth. And one of the best ways to do that is to learn from other people. Anybody can be a teacher  if you approach them with the right attitude. I mean a lot of people will teach you what not to do,  but that is certainly useful instruction especially within the context of experiencing less pain.  I would recommend using books and media with this intention. Don't consume content for pleasure.  Engage with media for your own edification, which is a fancy way of saying for your own good.  Seek out the truth contained within it that can help you suffer less, that can help you get off the  path of pain and onto the path of light. Like if you find one kernel of truth in a book that helps  you tread a bit more on the path of light, that's a book well read. The more you seek out the truth,  the more you will find it. When you begin to actually apply what you've learned in your own life,  you won't have to hit your head against the wall as much as you currently do. And you can learn  these lessons vicariously from others who have decided to stop hitting their own heads against the wall  and have succeeded in communicating their own transmitted pain as light.
