==================================================

When men get caught cheating, what's the first thing that comes out of their mouths?  It didn't mean anything. It was just sex.  And the reason they say this is, well, one, it's often true.  Like I said, men tend to compartmentalize more, so this might be an accurate reflection of their experience.  However, it also does tend to assuage the woman's distress and anger.  On the other hand, if a woman were to get caught cheating and the first thing out of her mouth is, it didn't mean anything,  then she just created an even bigger problem for herself.  Far from pacifying that man, he is going to go through the fucking roof.  And it's going to infuriate him for a very particular, but often unarticulated reason.  Namely, he has been then booze-old.  Well, he has had to provide time and money and commitment in order to get and keep this particular woman.  Another man has apparently been able to access the same sexual opportunity without paying even a fraction as much.  He didn't even have to care about her.  The betrayed husband will struggle emotionally, psychologically, and in some cases materially, with the lowering in status that his wife's behavior affects.  Cuckold has long been an insult bandied about by men when they are joccing for position.  It is potentially revealing that no female equivalent of this word has ever been in wide circulation.
