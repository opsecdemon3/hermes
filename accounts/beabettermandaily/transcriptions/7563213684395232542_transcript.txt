==================================================

Some men are absolutely better suited for marriage than for a life of freedom.  These men are happy in marriage.  They want nothing more in life than to wake up, go to work, and come straight home to their  wife and kids, odd infinitum.  This is the structure of their lives, and narrow and confining as it might seem to others,  it is preferable to a lack of structure altogether, which is what these men would face  in the absence of their marriages.  This is actually representative of a much deeper and universal human problem, namely,  people can't handle freedom.  In many places, especially America, we consider freedom not only to be a unilateral good,  but one of the highest goods to which people can obtain.  It is so valuable that it cannot be bought at two steeper price.  And yet, if that is the case, why do we everywhere find people in some sort of  unfreedom?  It might very well be that human beings are not designed to handle the state of freedom indefinitely,  to little freedom, wrinkles, and oppresses, but too much, and we seem to fly to pieces.  The alternatives seem to be hedonistic, debatory, or anomic depression, which might  actually be the same thing.  Whereas from wrote an excellent book on the subject called Escape from Freedom.  In it, he discusses all the various ways in which modern men flies out of freedom, and  it's attendant insecurity and uncertainty in deforms of intellectual, emotional, and spiritual  slavery, including most notably the adoption of totalitarian ideologies.  So the human animal, pure freedom, is isolating and vertiginous.  That's why, in Nietzsche's thus-spake Zarathustra, the protagonist lives in a cave at  the top of a mountain.  At such heights, the air is clean and bracing, but life is cold and stark at elevation,  which is why most people don't live there.  They live in the valley below.  The idea here is freedom is not a condition people can long sustain.  Everyone needs structure, even Zarathustra.  The question is whether that structure is going to be internally extrapolated or externally  imposed.  The former is the only way to ensure that your life is actually custom tailored to your  unique tastes, preferences, and temperaments.  However, the only way to create that internally extrapolated structure is to resist  adopting an externally imposed one, long enough to go through the difficulty and expense  of building such a structure for yourself.  And most people for a variety of reasons are unwilling to do this.  The majority of men are not going to have the patience, the discipline, the competence,  and the drive to build their own internally extrapolated structures.
