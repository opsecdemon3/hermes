==================================================

Every person, man and woman, has to be real honest with the person in the mirror.  Women cannot simply sit back and assume an advantage conferred by their sex.  Not all women are attractive enough to motivate men to chase, I'll say that again.  Not all women are attractive enough to motivate men to chase.  And of course, the vast majority of men are not attractive enough to motivate women to chase.  I don't need to say that twice. Everyone already believes that.  And if there is any doubt in your mind that is if you're unsure whether you're attractive or not,  then allow me to remove it. You're not.  Attractive people are a washing optionality.  They do not need to be told not to chase. They are already being relentlessly pursued.  Better medicine, but it's always better to strategize from a place of accepting reality than from one of wishful thinking.  The bad news is that not everyone is attractive.  The good news is that everyone without exception can be more attractive than they currently are.  Focus on what is in your domain of control.  Men, we can't all be over six feet tall.  But there's nothing we can do about that.  Are you taking care of your finances and your fitness and your fashion and your fame and your friendships, et cetera?  Women, you can't all be Instagram baddies.  But there's not much you can do about that.  Are you taking care of your fitness and your fashion and your femininity and your flirting and your fucking.  Focus on what is in your domain of control and play to your strengths because trust me.  The more attractive you are, the more likely you are to get more of what you want.  And that is a great feeling.
