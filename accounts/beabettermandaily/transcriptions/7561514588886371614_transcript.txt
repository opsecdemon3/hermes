==================================================

According to surveys, the majority of women in relationships, even married ones, have a backup partner in case their current relationships don't work out.  In most cases, this is a man they already know and have developed some form of relationship with whether it's an old flame or a friend on the periphery with whom they haven't yet initiated a sexual relationship.  Almost by definition, these options aren't as attractive as their primary partners.  After all, who chooses a less attractive option over a more attractive one they can get, all other things being equal.  And since most men aren't very attractive, most men will find themselves a woman's option as opposed to her priority at some point in their lives.  It is what it is.  Fortunately, men are often complicit in the decision to relegate them to an option role.  The most common way that they do this is by over pursuing and over committing.  As I've stated previously, the fundamental law of attraction is that people want what they want, not what wants them.  And a corollary to this law is that you cannot get someone to want you more by wanting them more.  Sometimes you can get them to want you more by wanting them less, but you absolutely can't get them to want you more by wanting them more.
