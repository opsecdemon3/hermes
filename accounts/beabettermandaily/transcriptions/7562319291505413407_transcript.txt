==================================================

Like, if all you post are thirst traps, then guess what? You're going to attract a lot of thirst  guys by the same token. If all you post is your yacht and your car and your jet, like what  are you? Some kind of transportation's are? I mean, in any case, you're going to attract a lot of gold  diggers because that's literally the only bait you're using to prevent this from happening.  You need to qualify your bait. You don't get rid of the bait. You don't know. You just cut that bait with  other offerings. Women, if you've got the booty, don't hide the booty. Men, if you've got the  yacht, don't hide the yacht. Booties and yachts are great bait and a little goes a long way.  If we're talking about social media, you really only need one pick of your boat and one pick  of your butt. The other picks can be used to showcase other facets of your personality and lifestyle  assuming you have them. Trust me, people will notice your ass and people, mostly men, will notice your  Porsche. You don't have to be so himfisted about it because if you are, you're only going to  attract the ones who are so dumb that they have to be hit over the head with it, over and over and  over and over again. And that's probably not what you're looking for, right? That said, you absolutely  have to bait your hook with something and listen to me closely. What you use to bait your hook  probably isn't going to taste good to you. And that's okay. It doesn't have to taste good to you.  It has to taste good to the fish.
