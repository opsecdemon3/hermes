      "transcription": "Pain is the gift that nobody wants. But listen to me carefully, it is your most trustworthy  teacher as you navigate through life. Why? Because pain gives you feedback, honest feedback,  with respect to how your behavior interacts with the world and how your mental models align  with reality. Pain will never lie to you. Pain will not try to protect your feelings. Pain  will always tell you the truth in a way that your partner, your parents, your therapist,  your priest, no one will be able to do as directly, consistently, and forthrightly.  You experience pain when you act on mental models that are not aligned with reality. For example,  if you think a stove should be cold when it isn't, and you place your hand on the burner  with that knowledge and expectation, you are going to experience pain. That is, you experience  pain when your knowledge is wrong, which is a nicer way of saying when you're ignorant. This  ignorance could be about the nature of current conditions. It could be about the rules  whereby we extrapolate current conditions into future conditions, and it could be about assumptions  with respect to what conditions should be attended to and what conditions should be ignored.  And the vast majority of this knowledge is gained through experience, which in many cases is a  euphemism for pain. Now, it's also important to understand that pain is not the same thing  as suffering. Suffering is pain plus judgment. The judgment that the pain is somehow unbearable,  wrong, unjust, self-defining, etc. And it can be useful to remember that pain is itself a  construct. Pain is sensation plus judgment. The judgment that the sensation is somehow  aversive, unpleasant, uncomfortable, etc. It's useful to remember that no sensation is universally  experienced as unpleasant. Like I guarantee you, no matter how painful you might consider a sensation  to be, there are people in this world right now who are seeking after that same sensation as a  source of pleasure. In any case, my definition of pain is that it's feedback from the universe  that you are somehow not in line with reality. Now, if you're like me, you've had to learn  your lessons the hard way. And as a therapist, I think that's everyone's right. Like I'm not going  to prevent someone from walking into pain. All counsel them against it, which is light, but I won't  stop them. Everyone has the right to make their own mistakes. And there might actually be  something cowardly and fragile about the person who just takes other people's advice and never fails  on his or her own terms. The lessons that people learn through pain are so deeply integrated into  their being that once they are fully accepted, they never unlearn them. And this is why the highest  wisdom is so often ignored by others. When it comes from someone else, it's kind of held at arms  length until the truth of it that is it's ability to help someone avoid pain in the real world of  actual decisions is tested and integrated.",

      "transcription": "Listen to me. A person who is unhappy and unsuccessful is not wise. A person who is anxious  or depressed is not wise. A person who is arrogant or victimizing or envious or irritable  is not wise. Maybe they have a little knowledge, but as they say a little knowledge can be a  dangerous thing. Internal states like these are the most reliable signs that a person is still  not in real alignment with reality to some extent. And you know what? That's okay. I haven't  learned all of my lessons once and for all either. We're all works in progress, but the trick  is to get better at learning those lessons sooner and with fewer repetitions so that we can  all of us walk more and more on the path of light and receive more of our instruction from that  truth. And one of the best ways to do that is to learn from other people. Anybody can be a teacher  if you approach them with the right attitude. I mean a lot of people will teach you what not to do,  but that is certainly useful instruction especially within the context of experiencing less pain.  I would recommend using books and media with this intention. Don't consume content for pleasure.  Engage with media for your own edification, which is a fancy way of saying for your own good.  Seek out the truth contained within it that can help you suffer less, that can help you get off the  path of pain and onto the path of light. Like if you find one kernel of truth in a book that helps  you tread a bit more on the path of light, that's a book well read. The more you seek out the truth,  the more you will find it. When you begin to actually apply what you've learned in your own life,  you won't have to hit your head against the wall as much as you currently do. And you can learn  these lessons vicariously from others who have decided to stop hitting their own heads against the wall  and have succeeded in communicating their own transmitted pain as light.",

      "transcription": "The majority of men are not going to have the patience, the discipline, the competence, and the drive to build their own internally extrapolated structures.  And since all men cannot long tolerate freedom, this means that these men will need to adopt an externally imposed structure or risk being annihilated one way or another.  In this way, I think we can consider that marriage is actually useful to a lot of men in precisely the same way that the army is actually useful to a lot of men.  It's kind of strange to equate the two, but they're more similar than we might think.  Consider the army.  The army is a place where young men who might not have any purpose, direction, or self-discipline can learn the value of service, can learn to stand up straight, can learn to be strong, can learn the importance of sacrifice.  They learn to get their lives in order to go to bed at the same time every day and wake up at the same time every day and eat at the same time every day.  And they learn the necessity of pushing through pain and discomfort in the service of an overarching goal.  They learn about honor, teamwork, and tradition.  And they learn valuable skills that can be useful both through their union and potentially through their larger society.  Sounds pretty good, huh?  I guarantee that the army is the best thing that has ever happened to some men.  So, why doesn't everyone enlist?  Well, first and foremost, everyone doesn't enlist because that isn't the whole story about the army.  But no recruiter is going to tell you the whole story ahead of time.  Otherwise, you might make an informed decision, which will absolutely lead to fewer recruits.  However, what is more germane to our present argument?  We can appreciate that everyone doesn't enlist in the army because the army isn't equally beneficial to all men.  And based on the good things the army is presumed to provide, it's easy to deduce the kind of man for whom the army would be most beneficial.  That is, if the army provides purpose, discipline, and competence,  then it's obvious that the army would be most beneficial to purposeless, undisciplined, and incompetent men.  And the more purposeless, undisciplined, and incompetent, the more beneficial the army would be.  However, men naturally vary with respect to these and other dimensions.  If you were to take a man who has already gone through the trouble and expense of becoming purposeful, disciplined, incompetent,  then not only will you find the army less useful, but he may fail to thrive in that environment as well.  This is because the very first thing that would happen, if such a man were to enlist, is that the army would go to work tearing down his internally extrapolated structure.",
