==================================================

Science is not the opposite of religion.  The belief in a personified God is not religious.  It's fucking crazy.  Because if you truly believe in an omnipotent omniscient omnipotent God,  then you would understand that science is the study of God.  Math, art, music, literature, science.  All of it is the study of God.  Everything that we do is to understand our reality and our existence and our place in this world.  And what is right and what is wrong and the existentialism of it all.  This idea that there's this personified fucking God that's like moving chess pieces around  is just fundamentally wrong.  Probably wrong.  God disagrees with you.  If you actually study God, you'll realize it's a lot more beautiful than that.  That if there is one, they created the rules for reality that have played out  billions upon trillions of times to create what we currently live in.  That all of reality is deeply interconnected and fundamentally interdependent on each other.  And that our understanding of reality is these distinct things.  A complete bastardization of God.  It's not like God's creation is beautiful.  That is God.  You believe in an omniscient omnipotent, omnipresent thing.  It is everywhere in everything and knows everything and feels everything and sees everything.  And it is fundamentally connected to all other parts of existence.  For most people, this is just become a bastardized mythology that they actually have no personal contact with.  They don't study art.  They don't study science.  They aren't actually good people.  They're solace and empty individuals who rely on this insane mythology to justify their very strange perception of reality.  That's why people rightfully have religious trauma because they're fucking crusades and genocides and insane shit that we do over this non-religious thing.  It is not religious.  You're not worshiping anything.  You're genuinely fucking crazy.  He retains me so much because I respect Christianity and Hinduism and Taoism and Buddhism and all the fucking  Islamism.  I respect all these religions for their actual true connection to the divine and what that means.  But so many people are tapped out of that so many people have no idea.  They claim to be a fucking Christian or Muslim or this or whatever.  Conversation should not be taboo.  There are so many people that walk around the world unchecked, respect for their religion.  No, you're literally just enabling a fucking psychotic person.  These people who believe in a personified God could not be further from God.  They are literally worshiping the devil.  Literally worshiping this distinct, non-connected, fucking authoritarian decision-making, rule-following, rule-creating, essentially like super villain.  It's just literally like, I love the boys so much.  I feel like homelander is not just a perfect image of Trump.  But it exposes this, like, this is gonna have to make another video about this because this is crazy.  But it exposes that this worship for Trump is actually just what Christianity has become.  And that is the bastardization of the religion at large.  It is the pinnacle of idolatry and cultism.  Literally.  It's a whole different sect of Christianity and I'm not joking about that.  That is not a metaphor or euphemism.  I love you all.  Take it all with the grain of salt, as always.
