==================================================

Yesterday I was playing paintball, which is why I have these hikki looking marks, but I hurt myself pretty better.  I got shot and just a pretty gnarly spot. And compared to everywhere else that I got hit, this hurt considerably more.  And I noticed that when I got hit, I acted like a 10 year old. I'm like, I'm done. I don't want to play no more.  The vibe was killed, the mood was killed. And I eventually got over it. But it took me like a good 10 or 15 minutes to just chill out and feel okay.  And be ready to keep moving forward. And you know, just looking back on that experience, I'm like, what the hell?  I'm 21, you know, like, it shouldn't be a big deal. But it was because it was the first arrow.  It was the first time that I had experienced a unique specific kind of paint in that way.  It's not my first time with paint. I have arthritis. I have, you know, a chronic disability.  And I don't know. I've had procedures that hurt really bad. I had a shot that felt like fucking snake venom that I had to take weekly.  So I'm not a stranger to it, but I was a stranger to just getting hit on the knuckles. I've been hit on the knuckles before hurt really bad.  And it just made me realize you cannot avoid the first experiences of life. You cannot avoid the first instances of paint that you come across.  And that's not what trusting life is about. That's not what finding pieces about you are going to be rattled.  Things are going to happen to you that you didn't know were possible. You're going to be destroyed and hurt in so many unique ways.  Just as you are going to be showing joy and beauty in so many unique ways. The issue is not the first arrow.  The first arrow is not suffering.  That instantaneous moment. It's hard to deal with. We don't know how to deal with it. We're not equipped for it.  It might take us a little longer than we're used to to become okay with it and to move on into like go of it.  But fundamentally, that second arrow is always ours.  Our complaining, our suffering, our misery, our attachment to the pain or to the experience.  That's always ours. And that's why we trust the universe.  Not because you're not going to get hurt. Not because new experiences are not going to happen to you.  But because no matter what happens to you, in any circumstance, you are always in control of your own suffering. You are always going to be okay.  That's all.  It's swollen to shit as well. Anyways, I love you guys.
