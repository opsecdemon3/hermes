==================================================

Information and debate do not change people's minds.  People's minds are not dependent on the information that they're presented.  It is dependent on their sense of identity.  And their sense of identity is dependent on their preferences for certain things in reality.  Our cravings for things like security and our avoidances of unique traumas  are ultimately what define our identities, our identities are relational.  They are not creative.  They are emergent based on our interaction with reality.  And so our interaction with information and the beliefs that we hold based on that interaction  is inherently through the lens of identity.  In fact, our experience of reality itself, our hallucination,  is literally dependent on our ego and on our identity.  And this is why if you're trying to convince anybody,  if you're trying to make meaningful and genuine change,  if you're trying to get people to adopt a new political system  or care about something, you will be unable to,  unless it is through spirituality, unless it is through genuine healing,  unless it is through therapy and understanding and love and acceptance.  If you present a piece of information to somebody and it changes their mind,  they were already primed to change their mind in that way.  They already were going to interact with information in that new sense,  and you have not changed them.  You have just catalyzed them.  True change with the heart and catalysis of genuine growth comes from being a loving and accepting person.  By being just what you are without a sense of relational identity,  by being healed and by being present,  what you do for other people is allow a true canvas of reality to be reflected back into them.  They're given all of the tools and information and opportunities to not just believe your worldview,  but to understand the world itself.  You become a portal into understanding something that is beyond their understandings of conception and categorization,  something that they too are underneath all of their levels of ego and identification.  By realizing yourself, others will become realized around you.  That is the meaningful transcendental change that causes all other changes in this world.  Your anger and desire for justice will not help these things.  It will only alienate and otherwise the bad parts of reality through this process of identification.  And thus you will never be able to fully accept or understand them,  and then you will never be able to allow those people who genuinely live that way to accept or understand themselves.  Because when we are not healed when we are a crooked,  we inherently introduce conflict and stifle these space in the presence for others to grow.  We all know that feeling when a narcissist walks in the room,  and we have to shut off a part of our personality.  We also know the feeling when that one's super open, hilarious, loving person walks into the room.  And we feel like we can be this part of ourselves.  We haven't dusted off in a while, you know.  Anyways, that's all I love you guys and take care of yourself.  Be nice to other people and check out Core Templations 8 on Substack Spotify.  Whatever platform you like.  Yeah, bye.
