==================================================

One of the things that becomes so apparent when you meditate is just how noisy your mind is.  Just how much you've got going on all the time that is nonsense, that doesn't matter, that's imaginary.  And it sort of makes you realize like, this is how I am when I'm doing nothing but paying attention to my mind.  How often and am I not even experiencing day-to-day life because my mind is just running off somewhere new.  And it's sort of easy to develop a hatred in that way for your mind and your thoughts and your scatteredness.  But that's reminds itself of course.  There's, you haven't escaped anything you just created in this cycle.  That's why I've read him as just letting go.  It's not forefitting control.  It's just realizing that there isn't a such thing.
