==================================================

This is day one of meditating for an hour every single day.  On this session, I decided to not move my hands, my legs, or open my eyes for the entirety of the hour.  This helps through establish a strong sense of determination and willpower.  And then it also helps you confront things like pain and discomfort.  Right around here, my leg completely lost feeling and started to hurt for pretty much the rest of the sitting.  The pain is okay, pain is not suffering. It's our wish or the pain to go away that makes us suffer.  And so once I moved beyond that wish, it didn't really bother me anymore.  You'll see though that my head is bobbing up and down or has been this entire time,  and that's also pretty normal.  Point of meditation is not to enter this perfect state of concentration, but to bring yourself back to the present moment.  Every time that I drift off and bring myself back, that is a push-up.  Doing this over and over again allows me to have mastery over my own mind, become more patient, aware and curious.  If you're interested in how to do this meditation yourself, I just posted a video on it.  And that will be posting these videos every day to help you guys and integrate this practice into your life and learn more about it.  If you're interested in that, I would appreciate a follow and I love you all. Take care.
