==================================================

This book has completely changed the way that I understand spirituality.  Spirituality is not about being assimilated into this amorphous oneness and being, being one with everything.  But it's also not about embellishing your ego and your sense of identity, your sense of distinctness.  But it's both.  It is both of those things.  It is about understanding you as an individual, unique, perfect expression of reality  just as much as it is about understanding that you are everything.  That everything is actually what allows the distinctness to arise, that you exist as this infinite interrelationship with everything else in reality.  The fundamental nature of you and everything else is that it is all dependent on itself.  You are not just a drop of water in the ocean, but you are also the ocean in a drop of water.  Your creative qualities, your intuitive qualities, the things that you feel make you, you are not things that you need to let go of.  They're things that should be intensified, that should be understood in a deeper sense.  And as you understand yourself deeper, you understand the universe deeper.  And as you understand the universe deeper, you understand yourself deeper because you are everything and everything is you.  It is both.  This is why all my content has been about art recently because everybody is in a different state of life, in a different state of being.  You need to do what you feel is most strongly an expression of you at this current moment.  Because knowing yourself because becoming what you are individually is also becoming the universe.  Biggest mistake I ever made was thinking that the ego is identity.  The ego is not identity.  It actually isn't really even responsible for identity at all.  The ego is just this belief that I am not dependent, that my truth exists as a quality of itself and not of this thing that is infinitely interdependent on all other parts of the universe.  So in this way, our personal truest distinguishable qualities are harnessed and confined and trapped by the ego.  And so we identify them with the ego.  We identify the intellect and creativity and all these beautiful qualities with this limited identity, with this limited understanding of the world that is not it at all.  Those unique qualities of you, the truest parts of you are expressed in literally everything in every single part of the universe.  And we are quick to look at the outcomes of the ego and the symptoms of a confined spirit as what the ego is.  But our imagination, our creativity, our passion and our drive and the things that you feel make you you do make you you and are also trapped and also are limited expressions of what you really are.  It's in the recognition that these things are both fundamental to you, but also not fundamentally true in that they only truly exist based on their relationship with the rest of the universe that truly frees us, that allows us to be exactly what we are.  Anyways, I'm sorry if that was gibberish.  Hopefully it landed for those who stuck around.  It's an extremely hard book to paraphrase.  It's an extremely profound book.  If you are interested in this at all or even if this didn't make sense to you, please go read this book.  Go check it out.  This will probably be one of many videos that I make on concepts apart of the book.  And yeah, anyways, I love you all.  I hope that clarified things for you.  Take care.
