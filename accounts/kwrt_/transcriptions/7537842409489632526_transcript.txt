==================================================

Greed is not human nature.  Human nature is that greedy people will accumulate wealth and power and then tell everybody that greed is human nature  so that we normalize their psychotic deranged behavior.  That if they were poor would be labeled a mental illness and is hoarding,  but isn't because when you are in a society devoid of real human connection and love,  you turn to aesthetics to guide your moral values  because you live in ignorance of the object of your desire,  not realizing how empty and soulless your life truly is.  Classism does not need a propaganda machine. Capitalism is not deliberately planned.  The same way that cancer does not deliberately destroy its host,  it just grows into this alienated dissonant obstacle  which interrupts the natural flow and harmony of living and spontaneous things.  The opposite of life and prosperity is not death, it is not ending.  Ending is just an opportunity for beginning.  The opposite of life is stagnation.  It's notes that agree and rhythm that is perfectly on time with no soul.  That does not tell a story, that does not live in this world of things,  but as a pattern that repeats itself and agrees with itself and exists in and of itself.  Ignoring that the fundamental meaning and importance in all things,  the thing that makes things distinguishable  is the acceptance of the complete, infinite, interdependence  and interrelationship of all things on each other.  Night would not exist without day, summer would not exist without winter,  winter would not exist without fall, the world would not exist without you  and you would not exist without the world.  And even in this sense, cancer would not exist without you  and you would not exist without cancer.  Everything has its place in the family of the universe  except for the perversion of othering,  except for the illusion of optimization and perfection and progress.  And this is why capitalism is fundamentally anti-spirituality,  not because there is any one part of this world that needs to be erased or eradicated,  but because the optimization, the idea, the abstraction that necessitates the system of living  is at odds with the fundamental truth of reality.  It's built upon pillars of sand.  Yes, it exists as an illusion, as a hysteria that we participate in,  but has no fundamental truth in the operation of things.  And so ironically, the only thing that is optimized is alienation  and separation from the natural world.  The only thing that grows is this useless tumor of beliefs and abstractions,  which is why we are obsessed with materialism in the Western world  because it is a quintessential feature of this capitalist system fully realized.  It is the Ouroboros, it is a never-ending cycle of production and consumption,  of ideas and the relations built on those ideas,  and it is all abstraction and circular and disconnected.  The more sure of things you are, the more skeptical you are,  the more you become locked in its cycle without creativity, without awe, without wonder.  We will look back on this as a tipping point in human history.  Capitalism is the epitome of egoic expression.
