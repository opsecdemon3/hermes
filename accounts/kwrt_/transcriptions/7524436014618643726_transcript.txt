==================================================

Discipline is not hating yourself to the point of change.  It's not beating down the old versions of you and burning them alive so that you can become  whatever you think is perfect.  It's having fucking courage.  It's waking up in the morning and doing the thing you don't want to fucking do.  It's doing it because you love yourself.  It's doing it because you want to push the limits of your reality.  It's the deepest form of self-love that you can express whatever sort of way that you are expressing,  whether it be meditation, whether it be working out.  Maybe it's asking somebody out, maybe it's public speaking, maybe it's finally chasing  your dreams.  Whatever it is, it is not self-hatred.  It is the deepest form of self-love and self-expression and courage.  Your hatred limits you from that.  It's a waste of energy.  You'll become shredded, you'll become smart, you'll become successful through hating  yourself but you won't become full.  You won't become happy and you surely will not overcome the reasons that you set out  on that path of hatred to begin with.
