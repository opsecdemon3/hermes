AI is not ruining education. Education has sucked, and AI is revealing how much it sucks.  If somebody can use a data interpretation software that predicts language to answer all of your questions and all of your tests,  then you are not really adequately testing people. This is just proof that you can recognize the patterns of the things that you were taught in school without conceptually understanding them.  Like, this is what AI is capable of. If I want to understand a paper, I can put it in an AI, I can have it give me a summary in what not.  And it has, you know, like a chatbot, whatever, like all these different tools and features is this going to give me a fundamental understanding of the paper absolutely not.  The only thing it's good for is regurgitating and reorganizing information. If that's all your education is, then your education fucking sucks.  These tools are amazing if you need to make a PowerPoint presentation and consolidate information, or if you need to break down something into simpler terms.  If you're able to use them to literally write a perfect essay, maybe it just goes to show that there's a good amount of just pattern recognition and regurgitation that goes into making essays.  Maybe we need to verbally test people. Maybe we need to actually ask conceptual questions and be creative and innovative in our education.  Like, we are an interactive species. We learn through trial and error.  We learn through puzzles. We learn through games. We learn through first hand experience of things.  Like, school is not engaging. We've been complaining about it forever.  And now that there's this alternative that really shows how unengaging it is, we want to say it's killing education.  I'm sure there's a niche example or two where this actually does like become really difficult to deal with.  But in the vast majority of situations, we just shouldn't have people reciting things.  It's just like when you're learning a language, you have to go to the country that speaks that language.  You can't just learn it from a home, studying a textbook, memorizing conjugation and verbs and all these different grammatical rules.  You have to go and use it. We learn by overcoming adversity and there's no adversity in school.  There's just like this stress of getting assignments done.  It's like this factory worker authoritarian scheme. You must make five thing of a Bob's by Friday.  Like, that's not a challenge. That's not engaging. That's not difficult to do.  Just nobody wants to submit their free will and autonomy to you.  People don't give up on those things and misassignments because they're not capable.  It's because they don't feel like they're challenged.  It's because they feel like it's useless. They're in a situation where they feel like they need to learn it.  Because they're totally unengaged from those situations.  Things like Chad GBT and TurboLearn and Grock should only be controversial because of the companies that support those things  and the data stealing and the environmental impact and all that other shit that they have.  It, as a technology purely through that lens, is healthy.  Just like phones are healthy.  These things aren't ruining society. Society was already primed and already, quote unquote,  ruined.  We just didn't have the technological agency to express our fucked upness and then see it firsthand.  Like, no doubt, there's short-term pain and suffering in addictions and all sorts of crazy shit.  To come with these things, it's Pandora's Box.  But ultimately, this is a catalyst for social development and change.  There's lessons that we are collectively learning as a society because of our newfound agency.  And one of them is that we need to bring life and community and passion back to education.
