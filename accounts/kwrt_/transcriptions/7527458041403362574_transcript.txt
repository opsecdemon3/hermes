==================================================

The lack of self-esteem and doubt in yourself is only enforced by you.  Everything that you are is where you place your time and energy.  Very thought that you have is a seed.  And the amount of time that you spend with it is how much you water it and how much you care for it.  If all you're ever doing is thinking that you're incapable,  you are literally making yourself incapable.  All you are doing is thinking that you can do anything,  then you literally will become more able to do anything you want.  Most people think that confidence comes from being good at something.  But there's a correlation causation problem here.  It's not that you become confident when you're good at something.  It's that the confidence makes you good.  That you're a decisiveness and intentionality allows you to bring the best version of yourself into manifest.  Do or do not do, there is no try.  You either express yourself at the highest capability of your skill or you don't.  And that's all you should be thinking about.  If you can be better, not how good you are,  just being with yourself and your current state of expression.  Because I promise you, your current potential and your current limit is so far beyond what you think it possibly could be.  Most people mastery just comes when they tap into that potential.  It doesn't even come with them actually getting better or learning any deeper mechanic about the thing that they're trying to get good at.  It literally just comes with them expressing their already known knowledge in this perfectly executable way.  And that's what flow state is.  Like a flow state is the state where something is just challenging enough,  but easy enough for you to actively feel novelly engaged with,  aren't you the one who sets the parameters for what is easy and what is challenging?  Who are the one in control of the reward and punishment system of your brain?  That feels good when it wins and feels bad when it loses.  Which is why through a deeper level of peace and presence, you will always be in flow state.  There is no second guessing.  There is just being.  There is just expression.  That's when things get fun.  That's when you fall in love with an activity or a part of life.
