==================================================

The idea that things should be this way or should be that way is not a productive or helpful idea  and actually doesn't really change anything in the world. When we focus on how we want things to be  and we say that the world should operate in this way, what we are really doing is operating from  a position of hatred. Hatred meaning that we are rejecting the fundamental truth of reality.  We're rejecting the condition of things as they are in favor of this condition that should exist  in the future or should have existed in the past. But the past and the future aren't real places,  they're abstractions of the mind. The only thing that has ever existed is this moment right here  and when we actually recognize that and take that to its fullest essence,  we also see that opportunity is in this moment. Opportunity is not in the future or in the  past. Opportunity only exists here and in that recognition there's a little bit of irony because  if you are looking into the future or looking into the past saying these things need to happen,  you are missing out on the opportunity here and now. You are missing out on the opportunity  to change, to act, to see and so in that hypocrisy we can actually empathize with why  things can't be this way or that way or that you know our shoulds and shouldn'ts aren't  exactly realistic because all those shoulds and shouldn'ts exist in this understanding that  we should have this constant free will. We should have this transcendent choice  in all situations but in reality it's a choice to tap into those things. In reality we're often  far off in the future or the past or in attachment or an aversion so much so that  we cannot be present with things and so things become the way they are because of the way that  things have always been. Our attachments and our frustrations they lead us into new choices unless  we are conscious and mindful and this is why it is so important to lead with love instead of  doubling down on you know forcing somebody to change or or forcing regret and shame into  your psyche. These things are not helpful because the only reason you ever did those things that you  regret or you think should be a different way is because you weren't acting consciously you were  acting out of this deterministic place and this is why I'm a compatibleist right because there is  this free conscious opportunistic moment that exists in the present but it is not something  that we are always tapped into and that is the grand school of life that is why we are here  to learn to tap into that present moment because the disconnection with that present moment  is what we characterize depression with is what we characterize sadness and emptiness and nihilism  with and this is why I often don't engage in political talk it's not because I don't care  about the affairs of the world or because I'm ignorant to them it's because I recognize that  things are just the way that they are and things will transform and change based on the way  that they are. I can't say that reality should be like this or reality should be like that because  everything is emergent our political systems that we currently hold are not in place because a bunch  of people got together and said we need to steer reality in this direction it's because a bunch  of people got together and said we all feel this way based on previous life events and things  that have happened to us and so history has taken its course right our politics are fundamentally  emergent from our social relationships just like the way that we view the world and our philosophies  are emergent from our internal parts relationships from all the different managers of our psyche  all the different voices in our head that have been created um in order to serve and protect  and and help us. Anyways I'm going to be making I have a job so I haven't been able to make  content recently but I'm going to be making more of these long term very relaxed rants I've  noticed that I got away from it probably because I was looking at views um I don't know why I did that  and it's kind of weird you know you you try to abstain so much from crafting an image on social  media um but I think I ended up falling into that trap so I'm coming back trying to be  more real I feel like I've done this like four times um and just and just push out some some thoughts  for you guys because it's not like I I lack them I just think wow this would make a good video um  anyways if you're still here at the end of the video I love you if you want to support me  I have a sub-sac and a discord that you can join um yeah see you in the next video stay curious
