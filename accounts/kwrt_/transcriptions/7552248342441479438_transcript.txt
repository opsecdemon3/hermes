==================================================

Mastering yourself is not about conquering yourself.  It's not about ignoring your needs, ignoring your pain, ignoring your regrets.  It is not the denial of all the things you wish to go away.  It is the acceptance of those things.  Those things, those things you want to leave.  Those things you would rather not admit are a part of you.  Our fruits born from the tree of you.  They come from the deepest roots of you are being.  And you are denial of them is not going to stop them from growing.  Mastering oneself is not a quick process.  It is not an adjustment.  It is not some forceful erasure of this rot that has consumed us.  It is cultivation and it is recognition that there is no rot a part of you.  There is only what you have cultivated.  There is only where you have spent your time in energy.  What experiences you have been subjected to that have led you to spend your time in energy and certain places.  And the realization that if you do not want to bear these fruits, don't water the plant.  Don't water the tree.  It will not go away immediately.  It will take time, but it will be permanent.  It is the only way.  When we go about this path of domination,  it may appear that we are very successful,  that we are very disciplined.  But in truth, many people who are supposedly successful,  productive, disciplined are not happy.  They don't discipline themselves out of an interest in growing the person that they are.  They don't engage in productivity of their own will or creativity.  They are not making things that they like or they think will help and save the world.  They do these things out of hatred,  out of not wanting to be the parts of themselves that they still water.  And so on the surface, materially, they may have many things,  but inside, they have nothing.  And that's why they surround themselves with nice things.  They are very, very poor people,  which is why they need so much.
