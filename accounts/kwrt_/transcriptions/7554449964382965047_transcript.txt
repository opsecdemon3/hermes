==================================================

Belief is trust. Belief is not this creation of this, you know, this alternate mythological reality that doesn't exist.  It's not making up shit that's not there. It's tuning into what is there.  And so if you go your entire life with this belief that the outside world has to make you happy, that your actions in the world are what make you happy,  that the things that you have are what make you happy, that it will be.  Because you're belief, you're trust and that part of the world allows you to feel that.  Think to yourself what good relationship have you had, where there was no trust involved.  In order to experience something we must be open to the experience of it,  Belief is nothing more than a precise trust in an experience, in the possibility of an experience.  It's pure in that way. It's curiosity in that way. It's love and acceptance in that way.  What is curiosity, right? It's a belief. It's a belief that if I look, I will find.  It's one of the most pure beliefs.  How many beliefs do you have that limit your experience of things?  How many experiences have you had from these beliefs that you hold so deeply onto that you say,  This is my life. This is my essence. I need this belief to keep me safe.  How many experiences has that actually given you?  Because that's the beautiful thing about all of this.  And you believe that something is possible. You experience it.  And then you realize it was your trust. And then you gain confidence in your trust.  You start to trust trust itself. You are consciousness within consciousness itself.  You're not just meditating on your body and your thoughts and whatever else.  You're meditating on the thing that meditates. You're able to let go on a deep and profound level.  And so absorb and experience on a deep and profound level.  The heart of our depression and our sadness lies a big fat well of cynicism and skepticism,  which ironically are beliefs.  Ironically are these trusts that the world is stagnant and physical and material and not changing  and only through physical experiences can we achieve any sort of happiness or relief.  And so that money is the goal and success is the goal and security and safety is the goal.  If you want to change, you must trust the change and believe in it.
