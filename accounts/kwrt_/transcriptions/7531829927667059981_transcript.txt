==================================================

Clarity is not going to come from sitting in your fucking head.  Clarity comes from action.  Clarity comes from expressing your creativity.  Depression is not some mental illness of sadness.  It is a lack of expression.  It is the lack of creativity and art.  And performing in the world.  You are an artist.  Everybody is an artist.  Everything that you do is a form or expression of your creativity in your worldview.  That you have gained by living in this thing.  Whatever this thing is, this source, this experience.  World is not happening to you.  You are the thing that is happening.  You create everything, a part of your experience.  And you decide exactly what you want it to be.  If you have this notion that you have to grow and change in order to get to this place,  then you will live in that reality where you need to grow and whatever in order to change.  But if you live in the reality where you can just change right now,  then you will just change right now because that's how it works.  Because you are the thing that's fucking happening.  Nothing is happening to you.  Nothing is coming to save you or change you.  You are the thing that decides the change through action,  through interaction and creativity and expression.  You become.  And that's terrifying.  And that's why it's hard.  Not because it's a question of whether you can or whether you can't.  But do you have the courage?
