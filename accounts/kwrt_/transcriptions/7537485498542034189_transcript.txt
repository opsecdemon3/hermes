==================================================

Quantum physics is not reliant on conscious observation.  It's reliant on energy.  The whole collapsing of a wave function, they say collapses during observation  because in order to observe something, we need to throw energy at it.  The reason you're able to see is because light is bouncing off of things  and reflecting its energy into your eyes.  The reason you can touch, taste, smell, etc. is because you're exchanging energy with your environment.  This is why in order to make quantum computers and study quantum effects  you need to have things very, very, very cold because temperature is vibration.  Even just the smallest amount of energy or noise will completely collapse the system.  Anyways, I bring this all up because there's this New Age mythology slash mysticism  that labels itself as spirituality, which is saying that we create the world  like through our thoughts or conscious observation or whatever.  And it's just not founded anywhere in science or reality or in genuine spirituality.  It's its own standalone belief with no root or basis in either the spiritual or in the physical.  And I think because quantum physics is a complex subject  most people are just impartial or indifferent to it  and don't correct these people when they see them say this nonsense  which is how hysteria starts.  Like let's not downplay this. If a schizophrenic or someone who is mentally ill and not stable  if somebody who has depersonalization dissociation saw that video  and internalized that information, that would be very harmful and disorienting to them.  Spirituality is not about freeing your mind from rationality or the intellect at all.  It's about this concise moderation of and valuing of all the aspects  and dualities that exist in our world.  Just as I criticize intellectuals and philosophy bros for being completely disconnected  from their living sensuous experience  I will criticize this because it's completely disconnected from rationality  and critical thought and reasoning.  Spirituality precisely is a compromise between our dreams  and the perceived physical that we live in.  The integration of all the parts of experience, of mind, body and spirit  of rational and creative, it is not exclusive to one attitude or one part.  People will get hung up on a dream or an idea that they've created  and they will fit all sorts of wrong puzzle pieces into their picture of reality  in order to justify this idea or dream that brings them comfort, that brings them peace  in the same way that many people won't even dream, won't even have an idea or an image  because they feel so beaten down by their disappointment in reality  that they only stick to what is true no matter what and seize to find meaning  or importance in any of it.  Spirituality is not either of these attitudes.  It's being present with the world as it is, doing what excites you  but not having an expectation for the outcome of it.  It's thinking rationally but not letting that rationality confine your dreams.  It's dreaming but not dissociating.  It's an agreement and a compromise because in compromise  you see things for the wholeness of what they are  because everything is completely, fundamentally interdependent on everything else.  When you compromise, you accept the full qualities of both sides.  You accept the wholeness of the package at hand.  Because you accept that wholeness, you also accept the distinct distinguishable realities  within that wholeness.  All is one and one is all.
