==================================================

Imposter syndrome has very little to do with your self-esteem.  Let me explain why.  For those who don't know, imposter syndrome is this feeling of inadequacy, despite physical circumstance.  Despite the fact that you're successful, that you've made it, that you've completed your dream,  you still feel like you are unworthy of that thing that you have done, of how you portray yourself to other people,  or of how the world views you.  But this is not because of a lack of self-esteem.  This is because of a wrong attitude, in your world view, that you are now coming into contact with.  Your sense of inadequacy is grounded in an hierarchy that you created, and you are now realizing, is not real.  You dreamt up ideas of what it means to be successful, and now that you are actually successful,  you realize those ideas aren't real.  But you want to hang on to your dreams so badly that you would rather feel inadequate,  despite the physical circumstances of you completing your dream,  then you would realize that this dream is just not true, that people are just people,  that people can be whatever they want to be, that it's all about perception and appearance.  And then at that end of the day, we're just a bunch of animals.  We're just a bunch of monkeys.  You're stuck in a catch 22 between being disillusioned by your world view.  We're keeping that dream, but in order to keep that dream, you have to keep delving into ignorance.  You have to keep satisfying your ego, and ignoring the science, present, and physical reality.  But if you do this, it'll only make the imposter syndrome worse,  because you will be given more facts about how this part of reality that you believe in,  that you once believed in, is not justified, it's not true,  that there are no hierarchies and true reality, that there is no rich, there is no successful,  there is no anything except what just ordinarily is outside of conceptual ideas.  In fact, even though we call it imposter syndrome, and that's what it's most known for,  this is a feeling that transcends just this situation.  This feeling comes up everywhere, as we are opening our minds and learning more about the world.  We are confronted with this dissonance between our egoic understanding of reality and reality itself.  And when I say egoic, I don't just mean a reality that puts you at the top of the hierarchy,  I mean a reality with hierarchy at all, the reality that is grounded in duality is substanceless.  It is not true, it is not real, there is no rich without poor, there is no pretty without ugly.  You cannot be down unless somebody else is up, you cannot be up unless somebody else is down.  Egoic reality is this abstraction, it is based completely in the relativity of objects to each other,  and ignores the fundamental essence of objects themselves.  And so if we really want to be critical about what this is, it's not just a inadequacy, it is self-hatred.  It is a lack of understanding of your true nature and the subjugation of your true nature.  You are confined into all of these systems that you believe yourself needing to win,  but there is no winning the systems because they're all relative.  There is no fundamental essence of success, there is no fundamental coolness or fundamental prettiness.  If you ignore this fact, you will keep reliving the same lesson over and over and over again.  And so overcoming this, having self-love, is not the process of mindlessly indulging in this confidence.  And this doubling down of your place in the hierarchy, I am this, I am that yes, yes me, it is acceptance of your true nature of what you really are.  It is being quiet and allowing your nature to shine through your actions, through your contact with your senses and physical reality.  Instead of this incestance speaking, this incestance calculating, it's conceptualizing and announcing that you are this thing supported by all of these other things that you have also created.  So, love at its core is just being.  And there is no inadequacy in that.
