==================================================

This is day two of meditating for an hour every single day.  Today was a lot harder than yesterday.  And I think a key difference is that yesterday's went really well.  One of the hardest things about meditation is that if you ever feel like you had a good session,  you will inherently form an attachment to that experience.  It's a pretty much this entire time that I was meditating.  I was not focused on the practice of meditating, but the outcomes of meditating.  I was bringing my breath back to my awareness consistently,  but that alone wasn't satisfying enough.  I needed some sort of experiential reassurance that I was doing it correctly or that.  I was making just as much progress as yesterday.  These kinds of obstacles are typically the biggest ones when it comes to meditation.  I didn't even really realize what the problem wasn't until I finished.  In times like these, I like to switch stuff up so I can stay fresh.  I do this by either breathing heavier, switching to an alternative technique or a little bit.  They're trying to do nothing but exclusively just relax.  There isn't one single way to let go of your attachment.  Enforcing yourself through one angle can be a sort of attachment in and of itself.  Long as you're devoting yourself to the practice and help the experience,  though it's okay to change it up.  On a separate note, I finished episode 7 of Report Simplations yesterday.  John Wesley talked a lot about my first days of experience and some more thoughts on meditation and creativity and meditation.  If you're looking for more of this content or more explanations,  I have a whole 45 minutes of me doing nothing but that.  I also want to thank you guys so much for the support on that podcast.  It's been awesome, reviving it, and I love you all.  See you guys tomorrow. Bye.
