==================================================

I used to make a bunch of videos on ego and spirituality and understanding consciousness  and there's one really critical thing that I got wrong about ego that I understand now  that I would like to share with all of you.  Which is that ego is not the arbiter of value.  It is just a confirmation of your value, of your energy, of your meaning.  Just like spirit is the alternate confirmation, the opposite confirmation of ego where there  is no actual structure to our energy, to our spirit, to our meaning.  Looking at things like this it becomes much clearer why non-attachment is freedom.  Because you are literally leaving the confines of your meaning in ego and you are allowing  it to be as spirit.  You are allowing your energy and your meaning and your joy to be unconfined.  In addition to this I understand derealization and dissociation so much more now because  it's occurred to me that this is a rejection of energy itself.  It's a rejection of meaning and importance itself.  It's like the ego folding in on itself over and over and over again.  It's this maze that we create in our minds where our energy cannot escape.  Which is why we become alienated and we feel this disconnection from reality because we  literally are.  We literally are not experiencing meaning and joy and whatever else because we have  this crazy fucking metaphysical confirmation structure in our minds that is preventing  us from feeling reality as it is, meaning as it is.  Back in the day when I was really getting into all of this stuff I did not understand  this and I thought getting rid of the ego was this good thing that I needed to do in order  to become non-attached.  But that's avoidance, right?  The desire to kill the ego is the ego itself and there's nothing actually to overcome.  There's just something to unlearn and to escape.  Something to just be and exist as.  Your job isn't to tear down all of these walls, it's to recognize that you can  just walk around them.  It's to see them and witness them for what they really are and how actually like  harmless they are to you.  How your ego is not this terrible, mean, oppressive thing but actually this really  helpful thing that makes a lot of sense and has protected you in many different points  of your life.  It's only through accepting and deeply understanding ourselves and our ego that we  are allowed to be free from it and move on to spirit.  Like our ego is this resistance to normal reality as it is.  We have this deep lack of trust for things because of these experiences that we've  had.  Through clarity and through meditation we can understand experiences as they are and  gain that trust back realizing that there was never anything wrong or inherently  terrible about reality.  And thus we don't need that part of our ego anymore.  We don't need that part of our identity anymore.  Our ego dissolves not because we're trying to make the ego dissolve but because we  are accepting and understanding reality more and the ego no longer serves any  purpose.  So I guess the key difference is like right from what I used to say is like this  is a natural process.  This is not something you have to force or be too aware of or freak out about.  It's just the reality of things as they are.  We're all stuck in this labyrinth of our own minds and through clarity and  awareness we can we can learn how to navigate it and we learn how to become  more and more free.  Of course everything that I you know said about phenomenology is still  true but this is a pretty critical realization that I think is important to  share so I hope you guys are having a good one there'll be more content  like this.  That I used to make and I don't really anymore in the future.  I've just you know I've been learning and I've been growing and now I feel  like I'm ready to talk about this stuff again.  So yeah I love you guys I hope you're doing well and take care.
