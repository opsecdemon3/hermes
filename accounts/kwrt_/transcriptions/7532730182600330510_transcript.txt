==================================================

Need to create without focusing on the outcome.  You need to create art regardless of whether it's good or bad.  You need to express yourself regardless of what you would like to actually be expressed or communicated.  By creating standards of what is good or bad, you are limiting yourself and your expression and your understanding of yourself.  When we create art without judgment of it or without expectation of the end product,  we are actively letting go of our traumas and our attachments and our self-doubts.  Because every time we create something without the need to categorize it,  we realize just how much of ourselves are uncategorized, how uncategorizable the world is.  And that the only reason we feel the need to categorize things is because we have a preference.  We like certain parts of a song more than other parts.  We think pleasure and this uniqueness and this novelness should be at the forefront of reality at all times.  This preference, this addiction to novelty is a bastardization of reality  because we fail to see that it is the uncomfortable parts of the song.  It is the silence.  It is the boring parts of the song that lay background that give contrast so that those beautiful parts can shine.  We are disconnected from the fact that beauty exists in uniqueness, not in an hierarchy.  And that there is no absolute.  The more that you create and you create and you create and you let yourself be stupid and silly  and you let yourself be the bridge to a song instead of the chorus  and you let yourself play the wrong notes instead of the correct ones in your brain,  the more that you realize that there is no right way to be or to live.  So in this process, you become the thing that you are.  To other people, they will only ever see those novel and pleasurable parts of your existence.  They will only ever see the magnum opus.  They will only ever see the addictive chorus.  They won't see the bridge and the foundation and the background and the story and the journey  that makes all of that possible, that makes that highest expression possible.  So there's this myth that is preserved that being a good artist means being the magnum opus,  means having the addictive chorus.  In reality, being a good artist, being a good person, being the absolute best expression of yourself  includes every part of the spectrum, the boring parts and the good parts  and the stupid parts and the slow parts and the learning parts  and the there is no part of your experience that you need to leave behind.  So go out and create and listen deeply to the thing that you are creating  and then create some more based on those thoughts and then listen deeply again  and then create and listen and create and listen and let this endless cycle of creation  and consumption be the process by which you become the thing that you are.  The process by which you unlearn this habit of creating only what you think is just  or consuming only what you think is right.  By doing this, you break the cycle.  You escape the prison of normality and hierarchy.  You escape judgment and rules and all the things that aren't actually real.  You become in touch with the world that you can feel and sense and listen to and hear  and lose touch with the world that you've been told to believe in  that you've been raised to be a part of.  Create and listen.
