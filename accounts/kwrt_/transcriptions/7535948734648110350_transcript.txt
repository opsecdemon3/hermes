==================================================

I'd love to clarify this so Ian says what is the difference between ego as identity and ego as personality and that fundamental  Eunice oneness meanness  He focused on non-duality for a long time tried to ignore the ego didn't work for him didn't work for me either man  totally get it  The point of life is to know what you are  essentially and I think that spiritual pursuit often gets clouded because we want the  intellectual answers  immediately that we can move forward with  but the truth of life is that we have no idea what we are and  What you feel like you are  is  Something that is going to be discovered over and over and over and over again  And that's what it means to expand your understanding the universe because you are the universe, but you're also you  the ego then is  distinctly a  Confirmation of your essence your essence is your creativity your intuition  Yeah, like all these beautiful  expressive things that are a part of your life and your ego is  This thing that keeps it  contained  The ego is not the essence. It is the the walls of of your essence the walls that keep  These things contained  That don't allow you to feel this infinite  Interrelationship with the nature of all things, right?  There's this distinct othering process that happens  Rather than a distinguishing process, right?  So a distinguishing process is understanding that what I am is dependent on what atoms are is dependent on what cells are is  dependent on the sky and the earth and everything in between but the ego the othering process is  believing that this distinct  Abstract expression of reality is in no way dependent to or related on all the other  Expressions of reality. So the ego is precisely this other ring  conforming  confining factor  It is nothing to do with the essential essence of you as with your spirit or your soul or whatever you want to call that and  It's okay that we don't know what the spirit or the soul is like that's the whole point  the whole point is is to know yourself because by knowing yourself you know the universe by  Actually fully embodying what you are  You let go of suffering  That's enlightenment, right? Like knowing yourself  Truly and the thing that you are is enlightenment. That's kind of the end goal. Well, I won't say goal  I say goal loosely but  The ego  Is trippy as it is  is also  Funded by the spirit and  It would be a travesty for us to get caught up  Othering ourselves from the ego instead of just distinguishing  Because it is just as much dependent on me as I am on it  It matters. It's something that is a part of your it's an expression of you truly  but it is a confining  Expression is a limiting expression  that  That unravels and its ignorance right so it's not about  Strangling the thing that strangles  It's about recognizing that the thing that strangles the thing that others  only others  Based on your other ring of it  It's trippy it's weird that's the best way I could probably explain it to you
