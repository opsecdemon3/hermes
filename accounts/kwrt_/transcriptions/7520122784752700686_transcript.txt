==================================================

Looks maxing fucking sucks and it's not because they're wrong.  It's not because they're wrong at all.  Being attractive does come with a lot of benefits.  It does change how people perceive you.  It does change how people look at your personality.  But since when was the only fucking point of life external validation?  How much have you missed out on because you've been so focused on how people look at you and what people think of you?  How much of your true passion and joy and curiosity have you sacrificed?  Just you can be noticed by someone else while you're not even noticing yourself while you don't even understand yourself.  You want other people so badly to be in your life but you're barely ever in your own.  Like being alone is not loneliness.  Solitude is not loneliness.  Loneliness is a lack of love.  It is a lack of acceptance.  It is a lack of understanding.  These are things you can give to yourself.  Instead of saying I need to externally of me.  These are things that you can generate from within.  The joy of being at peace with who you are and what you like and what you find important in this life is more valuable than anything anyone can ever fucking give you ever.  And it's not something you will ever find external of yourself.  We'll just keep raising your standards.  No matter how perfect the looks or the personality or anything else.  Because your problems are not external.  They're internal.  Who define them?  They're problems because you believe that they're problems.  You think things need fixing.  That's why there are problems to begin with.  You set the standard for that.  You don't have to exist in this fucking game.  That's the matrix.  The matrix isn't knowing niche social rules or fucking basic psychology.  The matrix is believing that it's all external of you.  It's believing in all this made up shit about jobs and cars and status and ego and attractiveness and intelligence and all of this shit.  It's not fucking real.  The only thing that's real is your senses.  Unlearn the world that you've been taught.  Get in touch with the one that you can feel.  Get in touch with your sense of reality.  It goes deeper than you think it can.  It goes as deep as you allow it to.  Your feelings of inadequacy and loneliness.  An unworthiness will disappear in the face of equanimity.  In the face of raw experience.  The face of things just being what they are.  Not attaching some fucking name and idea and concept and structure to it.  But your ordinary senses, the things that you have had since you were born.  The thing that you've had beyond language, beyond identity, beyond validation, beyond trauma.  That's what the fucking matrix is.  Not jumping ship into a new conceptualization or a new idea.  It's not some big realization that makes you all depressed.  It's the absence of realizing.  It's feeling.  It's just existing.  It's being.  It's ordinary.  And it's fucking awesome.
