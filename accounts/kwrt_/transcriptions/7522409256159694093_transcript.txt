==================================================

It's okay to miss a day.  Often times when we're forming a new habit, we view discontinuity as failure.  We'll do something for four days, twelve days, or even months straight, and then just one day,  or three days off, can make us feel like we're a failure.  It's important to recognize that you haven't lost anything.  Things don't just die when you forget to water them for one day, or even three days.  They only die when you forget them completely.  And there is no longer any process of watering.  Obviously, I'm saying all of this, because I missed my yesterday's meditation.  But that's okay.  I don't really care.  I'll be doing this for several months, probably until I quit TikTok, and seeing a single day, pales and comparison to that.  Don't stress about things.  Just water the things that you want to grow in your life and they will.  If you forget a day, that's okay.  The thing is not quitting.
