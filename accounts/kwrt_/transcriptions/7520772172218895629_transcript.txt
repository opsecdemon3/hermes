Stop constraining yourself. Stop saying you can't do this or you can't do that because it's a sin or because you have an attachment or because you don't want to be selfish or because you don't want to be this or you don't want to be that we are the things we don't want to be precisely because we refuse to look at those things precisely because we deem them a sin we deem them wrong we deem them on the human we refuse to acknowledge that they are inherently a part of us and so they fester they get messy.  They spend years in a dark corner in the back of our branch is growing and growing and while it's apparent to everybody else that that's a part of our character and a part of our personality.  We're completely unaware for the sake of preserving our own image more than actually being the good thing being good or being noble has never been about being not from birth or constraining yourself.  It's about accepting all the qualities of the human condition and loving them for what they are appreciating them and understanding them and giving them the freedom to become something better.  When you settle these rules for what you can or can't be all it does is prevent you from being what you already are you are perfect as is you need nothing except acceptance and love for yourself that is where change starts that is growth of the heart is only ever our denial of the world that brings us discord and chaos and despair it is only ever our hatred and subjugation of it not our acceptance and our love for it.
