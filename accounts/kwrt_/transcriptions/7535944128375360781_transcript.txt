==================================================

America looks like shit and feels like shit to live in and they do it on purpose because it's how they sell you consumerism and  Scientists wanted to study addiction in the 1970s  They did a bunch of experiments giving rats the option to either you know have heroin water or have normal water  And of course all the rats were addicted to the heroin water until  They learned that in an environment with healthy social relationships other rats plenty of things to do plenty of food  Plenty of like playing areas the rats never picked the heroin  We're so quick to say that the ugliness that's a part of capitalism is just a byproduct  But it's actually an essential feature of  Capitalism because if we were surrounded by nature and other people and healthy  Relationships and walkable communities and so on and so forth. We wouldn't form a relationship with Starbucks  We wouldn't form a relationship with brands. We wouldn't constantly use these things as like this comfort blanket of well  Everything sucks, but at least I can go do this at least I can pay for this  You know little sliver of experience and I think this is why capitalism is so exacerbated in America because it's like we're a young country  We don't have culture. We don't have history. We're not like Europe or Asia  We literally are founded on slavery colonialism and  Like mass immigration and we're just like a fucking melting pot of all these and we celebrate it  We say diversity is our strong suit, but really we're just like this homogenized  Nothingness right for corporations to just swoop in and enact their divine right  Obviously, I'm not saying that this is like deliberately planned, but it just is so much like in favor of the corporations  Why would they want to make anything pretty?  Why would they want to conserve public spaces like the biggest players in our society in our culture?  Literally do nothing to contribute back to us  And so this is a real reason America has a drug problem drugs are not illegal in Spain drugs are not illegal  And a lot of places in the world people have very easy access to drugs and a lot of places in the world  And they aren't addicted why because their environment is better than ours. They have a community. They have walkable places  They're surrounded by nature. They actually appreciate art. There's a culture there  They don't just have this like soulless amorphous fucking like video game lobby that is America  And I feel like this is all just like wrapped in a big bow of irony at the end of the day because it's like crime  Drug consumption degeneracy all these things that like conservatives are staunchly against or like we need to be hard on that  We need to be you know  traditional blah blah blah  These are all like natural symptoms of capitalism that will become more and more  exacerbated as  Capitalism sinks itself deeper into its like  contradictions and this is why I used to make so much content about how  Individualism and like these notions of free will are really destructive because that's sort of like we have this like moral  Grandstanding that makes up for these like apparent symptoms of capitalism. We just say like oh, you know  It's like it's the people's fault. They're just lazy  They could be rich if they tried blah blah blah like on top of capitalism having its contradictions  It's just so like deeply anti-human anti spirituality anti-connection and realization  It literally asks you to deny the evidence of your own eyes and in favor of some like  Mythical notion of economic progress and prosperity. I don't know. That's all I got
