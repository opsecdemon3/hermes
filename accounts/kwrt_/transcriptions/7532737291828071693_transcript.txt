==================================================

You don't have a true self, but you also have a self, and here's what I mean by that.  As humans, we are obsessed with the world being full of these external, distinct objects.  We want to think of things as being absolutes, as being the fundamental things contained in and of themselves.  That an apple is not just a collection of atoms, but it's an apple.  That things as they appear are not based on their reference to other things, but are their own independent standalone thing.  This is our biggest misunderstanding of reality and why this self is so hard to understand and talk about.  Contrast is what defines everything a part of this universe.  If it was summer all of the time, then there would be no seasons.  If everybody was rich, then there would be no richness.  The reality and the value of things is dependent on their reference and their relativity to other things.  And so yes, you are a real thing, but you do not exist fundamentally.  The same way an apple doesn't exist fundamentally, and that's okay.  That's not a scary thing.  That's not something that denies your identity.  If anything, it accepts the wholeness and the actual truth of your identity,  which is that you are not just what you are now.  You are everything you have ever been and everything you will ever be.  You are the journey.  You are the link of events.  You are the awareness to the story.  Life is like an art museum, and so badly we go from picture to picture, painting to painting,  trying to find what resonates with us the most,  trying to find in the external what we are.  Without realizing they're all paintings.  They're all illusions.  They're all unique expressions of reality.  And the thing that we are is the witness to those unique expressions.  The compilation, the reference to, the interaction with all of these things.  You don't need an absolute.  What is the purpose in an absolute?  Is there anything that's absolute in reality?  Can you even ground yourself in existence with an absolute?  It's an abstraction, born of this idea that since there's a relative,  there must also be a polar absolute, and there isn't.  Everything in our universe is interdependent on everything else, infinitely.  One of my favorite quotes is by Thich Nhat Hanh, and he says,  Enlightenment is when the wave realizes it is the ocean.  And as much as this is true, we seem to believe that  there's this absoluteness a part of the ocean.  That the ocean is the only thing that we've ever been, that the wave is useless,  that there's a rejection of the identity in enlightenment, but there isn't.  There's a full acceptance and wholeness.  You don't stop being the wave.  You just realize the dependence of your existence on all other things in existence.  The first part of our life, we spend believing that we are the painting.  And yes, it is a beautiful realization to understand that the painting is an illusion,  and we are the thing witnessing the painting.  But that does not mean that we are also not the painting.  That does not mean that we are this absolute thing that is separate from everything else.  The object is just as much dependent on the witness  as the witness is dependent on the object.  You are both the expression and the expressed.  You are the witness and the witness.  You are a relation, non-absolute-ness to the highest degree,  which is why you don't need to try.  The most perfect expression of you is your experience.  I love you guys.  Take care.
