==================================================

There's this thing that I feel like everybody subconsciously engages with and they don't realize  it and that Loki drives me crazy, which is appeal decay.  When we're talking about a subject and you're addressing somebody who is ignorant, who is  misogynist, who is racist, who is narrow-sighted and closed-minded, people will constantly  make compromises with these people on critical points that they should not.  Like when we're talking about masculinity, why are we giving up this critical point  or idea that masculinity is a real thing that needs to be maximized and optimized?  You can just say that that's bullshit, by the way.  We don't need to redefine masculinity as femininity, as this, as that, to the point where it's literally  fucking unrecognizable to the opposing party.  We can just say, why do you believe in masculinity?  Define masculinity.  Make an argument for the thing that instead of meeting them where they are, because  what you end up doing is, it's like a lizard tail, right?  Lizards will shed their tail when a bird is trying to pick them up in order to save their  life, right?  And people will give out millions of fucking lizard tails in conversation just to try to  stay in the conversation longer.  You need to draw a hard line.  You need to let them fucking pick you up and try to actually understand your entire  worldview for what it is, even if it's a hard pill to swallow.  This kind of compromise only brings the conversation closer to the fascist, the ignorant, the racist,  whatever.  And it never actually challenges them critically.  Because again, when you try to repackage what masculinity means in these terms that are  completely foreign to what their idea of masculinity is, it's not convincing them  at all.  There's just this dissonance and you just look like you're coping because they  think, oh, he's existing in my same worldview, except he clearly does not have any true genuine  feelings about this and why would you define masculinity in that way and this and that, whatever  else.  And it just makes you look weak to them and ignorant to them and crazy to them.  It is such a benefit to those ignorant people when you give them these lizard tails.  And so there's this appeal decay.  Conversations go from being these critical, well thought out conversations with a  clearly stronger point and a clearly weaker point to these points that are almost like homogenized,  like they're almost like equal, it looks like, to any unsuspecting or uncritical party because  you've conceded so much.  And I think this is also why like, there's this, well, the both sides fallacy, oh my  God, do not get me started on this, this whole like new era of just being like,  Oh, well, both sides have their points.  Like, that is the epitome of appeal decay.  People so deep into handing out fucking critical points that they literally cannot tell the  difference between one side and the other.  And they think that there's like these minor nuanced differences and that's it instead  of like these major critical differences and believe.  Anyways, that drives me nuts, so I hope you guys can relate.
