==================================================

You just start discerning between what you actually want and what you wish you want.  If you actually want to go to the gym, then you'll go to the gym.  But most people just wish to want to go to the gym.  They want a version of themselves that would do that.  Because they want the thing itself without the actual effort required to get the thing.  And so they are completely disconnected from the thing.  They're completely disconnected from the gym.  They're a want to be in the gym and they're active not participation in it.  Leeds them down this path of self-loathing.  Like, why can't I have this thing?  What's wrong with me?  It puts you into stress.  To be honest with yourself, be honest with what you want right now.  And with how you're operating right now.  There's nothing wrong with being in a certain period of your life.  I love it to flower for like two years.  Honestly, the only thing that made me really quit it was letting myself have it.  Letting myself indulge in it, admitting to myself that I want this.  And I need this right now.  Totally when we confront what our actual self is, what we actually want.  And what we're actually looking out for.  That we are able to actually move forward and change.  If you can't accept what you are right now,  you will never become something new.  Toxic relationships and habits will just stay a part of your life.  To find yourself upset that reality isn't bending the way you want it to.  Remember, your current lifestyle is not a problem.  It's the solution to your problems that you don't want to look at.  Let yourself be, except that these are your solutions.  Actually look at your problem.  And then you won't need these negative habits anymore.
