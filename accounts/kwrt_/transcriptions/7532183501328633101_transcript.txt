==================================================

The problem is not information.  The problem is not you needing to see more or hear more or learn more.  The problem is that you don't do anything with all the information you already have.  Life is a universal thing.  We're in a fractal.  We're in a pattern of a pattern of a pattern of a pattern.  You can inspect any one part of this reality and learn about all the other parts in it  from that because everything is infinitely interconnected.  The problem is not information.  It's how much you're actually paying attention.  It's actually how closely you are looking at things.  This is why often times when we describe enlightenment or becoming more conscious we say we're remembering  things.  This is why I say that I don't provide knowledge.  I hope you guys remember things you already know because to somebody who hasn't experienced  the things that I have watching my videos probably sounds like absolute gibberish and  I get comments about that all the time which is totally fine because I'm not providing  experience.  I'm reminding people of their experience.  Is it helpful to learn new information and read books by other people and do all these  things?  Of course it is.  But it is not the solution.  No matter how deeply this life can speak to you in terms of external objects it is  ultimately up to you what you intake what you get away from it what you listen to  because before anything ever passes into your mind from the outside world it first  goes through a filter and that filters you.  That filters your identity it's your sense of self it's your world view it's your emotional  attachments this is why meditation provides clarity because it lets you tap into what  you already have.
