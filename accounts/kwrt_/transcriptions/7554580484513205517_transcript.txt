==================================================

Spiritual change happens completely spontaneously.  It is an in the moment thing.  It is not something you cultivate.  It is not something that comes to you after a certain amount of effort.  It happens now and it happens in your belief that it will happen.  It happens in your inspiration that it will happen.  It is literally a self-generated thing.  In the only reason we talk about cultivation and spirituality  is because, yeah, you don't have the opportunity to be spontaneous if you're dissociating.  If you're not aware of the present moment.  If you're not in some way, literally physically capable of having like a distressed enough relax  enough moment to breathe, to actually notice what's happening.  But do not get it twisted.  You cannot just fucking sit there and meditate every day and and hate it and then eventually  get some sort of outcome.  That's not how it works and that's why Zen Master is constantly say like the best meditation  is no meditation or the best meditation is not trying, you know.  They don't literally mean doing nothing.  They mean being spontaneous, the way an apple spontaneously falls, does the apple have  momentum?  Yes, is the apple falling guess, but it's effortless.  It doesn't try to fall, it just obeys the laws of reality.  And so in this way, spirituality is less about fucking crafting yourself into something.  And more about just being the thing that you already are.  And this is just a great rule for life.  Like, don't be things that you're not, don't force things that you're not, don't cultivate  things in your life that you're not.  If you're cultivating something, it should bring you excitement and joy in a level  of spontaneity into your life.  It should not be like, I'm doing this every day and eventually I'll get an outcome eventually  things will be good.  Like, transitionary periods are a great way to realize you're not living life.  Life is not a transitionary period.  There's no part of life where you're just like, I'm sticking it out until it's next part  that should never be how you live.  Your time is valuable, your energy is valuable, your life is valuable.  If you're doing something you don't like, if you're cultivating something that's  not worth your time, that's what needs the quote-unquote change, but that only changes  through not trying, that changes through spontaneity, that doesn't change in cultivation.  You see what I'm saying?  Anyways, sorry, I haven't been making TikToks recently.  I have a full-time job, so maybe you guys get more card TikToks or something, but it's  really hard to manage.  I love you all still.
