==================================================

I don't think everyone will understand me and that's okay, but Minecraft was so much more than just a video game.  That was a world that I lived in, and it taught me so much and it was so expansive and inviting and forgiving.  And I played a lot of video games, but I have not had an experience like the first time I played Minecraft in 2011 since I've been playing.  And I think a lot of people write that office like nostalgia, right?  I think things are always better in your memory, but no.  What if nostalgia is just remembering things that were good?  And what if younger me was just a lot less hurt than current me is?  What if younger me had a lot of shit figured out and being open and being creative?  When I was younger I let the light exist in things.  I didn't ask for the world to be complex and this astonishing way to prove itself to me.  I imagined the world that was beautiful and expansive and I helped out when reality didn't paint that picture.  You know, we talk about innocence being something that we lose and gain.  But I never felt ignorant as a kid to to all the pitfalls.  When I look back and I think about innocence, you know, maybe when I was like five,  maybe when I literally could not imagine what the world was like,  but that naivety and joy and excitement that I had, that was just my spirit.  That was just openness and love for life.  And I wish I still had it.  It wouldn't make me naive or stupid or ignorant.  When the game lied, it's not like I was immediately sucked out of that immersion.  I let that slide.  I let that part of the magic trick go unquestioned just so the magic could stay alive.  The world really isn't our minds and this subtle expectation to have somebody fool you,  to have somebody put the awe-inspiring experience in your at-lap,  to not have to put any effort into imagining it or having faith in it or loving it.  It just doesn't work.  It makes you miserable and puts you in this perpetual loop of always looking out for the next best thing.  Wondering why none of that will ever compare to those first experiences you had in your life.  At the end of the day, you write the rules for it all.  And I think with a life full of pain and confusion,  we write some pretty shitty rules to keep ourselves safe, to keep ourselves comfortable.  And in all honesty, to keep our spirit contained,  it's just funny paradox of trying to not act like the fool by taking yourself seriously.  But only a fool takes themselves seriously.  What's the harm and enjoying and appreciating life without reason?  Just for the sake of it.
