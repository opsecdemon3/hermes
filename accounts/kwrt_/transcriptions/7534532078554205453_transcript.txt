==================================================

Alright, you're a smart person, right? Like you understand like some esoteric concept that nobody has ever heard of and you are just so lonely because nobody else  understands what you know and what you understand and you just appreciate the esoteric so much and the true nature of reality and all these concepts and beliefs  except if you are only ever focused on other people understanding that you understand something.  Get on my pocket. You don't fucking appreciate it, man.  This is why I respect mathematicians because they'll go get a, you know, like a fucking seven-year fuck-ass degree in abstract algebra and spend like three to four years trying to understand something  without any intention of ever being understood by anybody else outside of that field just for the love of the game.  It's so crazy when we talk about like this othering process that happens when you get deeply invested in spirituality or like esoteric ideas.  That loneliness is not a part of the ideas.  That loneliness is your narcissism facing dissonance when confronted by the beauty of reality.  And now there's nobody to validate this thing that's giving you all this life and you're so confused because that's all you've done your entire life is just be understood  and want to be understood by other people and have this external validation.  And now there's something that you only internally can appreciate.  Just stop. Just let it be.  Go get a fuck-ass degree in mathematics and like meditate on one really strange concept.  Yeah.
