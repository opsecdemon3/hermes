==================================================

It's so hard to convince people that they're being exploited under capitalism because of the homogenization of responsibility.  For example, when I get a $30 parking ticket, most people do not see that parking ticket as at least two hours of labor at minimum wage.  They see it as like this amorphous abstract thing that is so much easier to cope about and to fucking write a narrative about.  Well, I make a hundred dollars, that's not that much. Like, we do this numeral comparison rather than this tangible physical feeling comparison of how the system actually affects our lives.  And this process makes the evils of capitalism so much harder to communicate, to recognize, and to label even though that doesn't make the effects any less.  Like, I will never forget the day I was talking to a homeless person on the street about, like, how, like, I'm just equally as broke and I can't pay for his, you know, his meal or his lunch or whatever.  And then I turned around to see a fucking McLaren, which is easily tens of thousands of meals just sitting around as somebody's fucking toy.  The immediate write-off for whatever is that someone earned that, which, one, is not true, but it doesn't even matter if it's true because even if you somehow earned 100,000 fucking meals or whatever,  what kind of system or society do we live in where it's incentivized that you just go buy a toy with that instead of contributing to society with that?  How are you even like paying taxes on that amount of money that you're making and those taxes aren't even covering this fucking dude's livelihood?  And that's why the evil in capitalism is not just the rich, it's like its own living organism that just inherently sort of divides us and alienates us from physical, tangible reality.  Like, I was just thinking the other day how ridiculous the two-day weekend is and how we could probably have another entire day and how that would be better for everyone and we would probably get just about as much done considering how efficient our technology and our society is.  But then I realized like our society doesn't want to maximize human life or human experience, our society wants to maximize these funny numbers.  So any sort of efficiency or improvement under capitalism is just like, oh, great. Now, instead of, you know, making $200 a week, we can make 211 instead of giving people like 10% of their time off for the week,  it just becomes another thing that just is added to the sum total, the profit margins of the rich.  I mean, basically to put things simply, the entire idea of liquidating something, of just turning a physical thing or process into money is the root and basis of all alienation.  Like, money really is the root of all evil, not because of greed or anything like that, but just disconnection from reality.  And you know, it has its purpose, right? Like, it's a great servant and a terrible master.  But in order to utilize it without it literally like controlling us and utilizing us, like, we're no longer in control of this system anymore, we actually have to have regulations and policy based around tangible, real shit.  You can't own factories. You can't own fucking power grids. People are only allowed to work this many hours, you know, like, and honestly, you know, it's probably a dead thought because where's the incentive to ever build a society like that?  You know, and that's why I always say politics is emergent from social behavior and spirituality. So that needs to come first.  But yeah, we're just like caught up in this like net, this stretching web of rules and this person needs this person and this person needs this amount of money and this person needs this process to happen at this time.  And it's like, why? Why? It doesn't, none of it makes sense. You're not, we're not doing anything. It's just like this obsession with quantity and the idea that everything is increasing, getting better and getting more awesome or all the fucking time.  Anyways, this has been an official court round. Expect them every Saturday or Friday because I have a job now, so I'm just a fucking slave. Love you guys.
