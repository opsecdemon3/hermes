==================================================

You do not create your identity. You choose your attachments. And here's why.  Idea that who we are and who we identify as is some sort of thing that we've built up or created  is correct in some certain way. But foundationally, the reason that you are the way you are  is because of your attachments, because of your preferences for reality. You crave certain things  and avoid other things. And those cravings and a versions lay the foundation for all of your behavior.  It doesn't matter how you deal with those cravings and a versions. Maybe that's the creative  part that you feel responsible for. But the trueest essence of your identity is rooted in those  attachments. This is why the self is not real. Yes, you are really, yes, your identity is a thing that  is happening. But foundationally, there is no essence of you. There is no essence of your identity  because it's completely relational. It exists to serve your attachments without the attachments. It  wouldn't exist. You wouldn't come up with all these creative methods to deal with your craving  for, I don't know, attention or your version of shame. In this way, life is not about creating  yourself. It's not about letting life create you. It's about unlearning yourself. Realizing  that there is no self. Realizing that with self comes suffering with this identification and  authorization of aspects of reality. By saying, I need this or I need that you fundamentally  miss what is, what is here, what you are. It's just something that is so much further beyond all  of those attachments. That creative energy, your spirit, your joy, your passion. Those things  are not emergent from your identity. They're confined by it. You let go of your attachments. You  find true freedom. The best parts of you are expressed unburdened by this need to serve in  attachment. Many people want to talk about how attachment is suffering and how leaving it will  make you happy. They say, well, if I'm not attached to anything, what would I do? What would  I, you know, what is my purpose? It's the best part. What you do is free. We are scared of that  freedom. It's scary to us to imagine that the things that we do aren't simply to preserve one  thing or avoid another thing or create some outcome. But simply for the thing itself. When you play,  are you thinking I need this or I need that or are you in the moment? Are you with the universe  and flow? Do so many things participate in sports, exercise, dedicate ourselves to so many practices  to experience just a fraction of this. Just to forget ourselves for a moment. Because that's where  the true version of you is. You are not yourself. You are something beyond that. You are something  experienceable. You are not something describable and relational to symbols and wants and whatever else.  Our serenity and peace and joy and inspiration and curiosity and love. Beyond that, beyond what  those words can express. This is not a philosophy. This is real. You can meditate and experience  a level of clarity that makes this obvious. It makes you feel like you're remembering something  you forgot when you were two years old. Stop striving. Stop trying to fulfill your attachment.  Stop securing yourself in this identity that was created to protect and serve you.  Notice how it doesn't protect and serve you. Notice how it makes you suffer. How you're wanting  for things is the bad part of life, not the pain, not the shame, not the embarrassment or the  lack of attention or the innocence. Dundity is something you can have sympathy for in this way.  It is you doing your best to figure reality out with your ignorance. Just trying to get  by and supplement yourself in whatever way you can. But at rest, tell it it doesn't need to perform  any more. Be at peace with it. Have compassion and love for yourself.
