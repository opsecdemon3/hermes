==================================================

I'm going to teach you how to get into meditation in exactly one minute.  One, it does not matter how you set, be comfortable.  Two, we're not trying to self hypnotize.  Don't rock yourself back and forth.  Don't get into a rhythm.  Don't conceptualize anything.  Don't lower yourself into a trance.  Three, we're not trying to achieve any sort of state.  Meditation isn't about achieving some transcendental state.  It's about mastering control over your mind.  Now let's get on to the technique.  With your eyes closed and whatever position you like, draw awareness to your breath.  You're not looking for anything.  You're not digging into anything.  You are simply being with your breath.  An easy place to put this awareness is right at the tips of your nostrils.  And you don't have to pick that spot but wherever you do pick, stick with it.  Now as you are aware of your breath coming in and out,  what's going to happen, which happens to everybody,  which is a totally normal part of meditation.  Is that your mind is going to wander?  That's okay.  The point isn't to stop your mind from wandering.  The point is is that when you wake up in a new rabbit hole on the other side of  town that you just go back to your breath, that's the entire point.  That's a push-up.  It doesn't matter if your mind wanders for 30 minutes straight as long as you bring it back  to your breath at the end of it, you've been meditating.  You've made a very powerful decision that will grow your mind.  No matter how hard it is in the beginning, you are making progress.  It will come a point where your mind doesn't even wander for more than two minutes  before you bring it back to your breath.  It's just a matter of patience and persistence.  Do not be upset at your mind for wandering.  Do not create for your mind to stay in the same place.  Do not do anything but bring your awareness back to your breath.  That's all for this introductory video, but I'll be making more videos soon with tips and advanced techniques.  I love you guys, and I hope that helped.
