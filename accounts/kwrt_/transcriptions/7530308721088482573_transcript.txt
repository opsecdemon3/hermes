==================================================

Guys, literally everything is performative.  The way that people speak, what they wear, how they present themselves, it is all intentional.  They do it because they want to avoid certain situations and they crave for other ones.  That's how humans work.  That's how identities work.  It is all something that we invest time and energy in because we enjoy the result of it.  We want to be in certain situations.  We want validation.  We want to protect ourselves.  It is not like this natural thing that happens, but it's not just like there are true  old people and performative old people.  They might be in it for different reasons and maybe that's your gripe or whatever.  But everybody presents an image or engages in a belief of an identity to serve themselves.  identities are not like these identities are completely emergent of what you care about  and what you are attached to in your life.  It is completely dependent on your privilege and your experience and your unique experience.  The real reason you see all this content about performativity is not because these people  actually have anything of substance to say, but because they are irritated because  in those performative people that they are making fun of, they see themselves.  They are cringing, they see something that they think, oh, I do that better.  I'm more sophisticated and advanced than that performative person.  My performance is so much deeper.  That's all it is, fundamentally, that's all it is and it can be nothing else because  I don't give a fuck about performative people because I understand that we're all the same.  If you give a fuck, it shows that there's a reflection of you in that person and what  you're making fun of, that you haven't come to terms with, that you're in denial about  your identity and why you do the things that you do.  We're so quick to otherwise and talk about how weird and insufferable other people are,  but we're all just kids, man, we all just didn't get things that we needed or were  failed in certain ways in our life.  A little bit of kindness and mindfulness goes a long way.  We're all just trying to figure it out, it's everybody's first time living.  Stop spreading, needless hate.
