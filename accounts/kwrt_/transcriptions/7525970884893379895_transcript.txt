==================================================

An entire world is just family systems.  From inside our own mind to our families, to political systems, to countries,  every piece of social conflict is based on individuation and identity.  Because of this, systems in our life and our families and in politics are hard to change,  because we often see them as things that we choose.  Not things that are emergent from individually chosen identities that are interacting with each other.  I know this is going to be a basic example, but we only have international relations and issues with that.  Because we identify as multiple different countries.  We only identify as multiple different countries, because we identify as different cultures.  We only identify as different cultures, because the substituents of those cultures  identify with different traditions and value.  And it all just keeps boiling down into smaller and smaller family systems,  until we arrive at the ultimate family system, which is internal within us,  which is the cause of all this harmony.  We don't just have one mind, we have different parts and identities that are at odds with each other.  There's an entire system of therapy based around this called internal family systems,  and there's a book, No Bad Parts, which is extremely useful for understanding this  in greater detail if you want to know the practicality behind it.  But you can relate to this without reading that book.  You have made decisions where a part of you says yes and a part of you says now.  There's a part of you that tells you you should binge things all day.  And there's another part of you that stresses you out for binging those things.  We are constantly in contradiction because of our identification.  It is our preference and attachment for reality that necessitates roles and thus identities.  And it is not even that we create identities to fulfill these preferences.  The preferences and attachments themselves are the identities.  They are simply reflected through us in our interaction with those external identities.  There's an emergent behavior that comes from your preference,  which we say is the identity or the role.  We say it's the coper or the manager or whatever part of yourself that works with that attachment.  When we leave ourselves of that attachment or that preference for reality,  we also free that identity that we have created that is emergent around that preference.  This is how the ego dissolves.  And this is why politics is just emergent from spirituality and emphasis on therapy and  interpersonal systems and healing and personal growth.  It's the only thing that actually will make meaningful change and any sort of larger system.  It's not that people in happy countries are happier because of their policies.  Their policies are better because they're happier because they're more healed because they're  more grounded and in touch.  Class consciousness is just the individuation of a much larger substance.  Consciousness itself, spirituality itself.  We're categorizing one very simple realization of it on a sociopolitical economic scale.  Rather than on a deep internal level, understanding that all classification and categorization  is inherent bastardization of our reality, of how things are.  The only reason you would even need these categories and why this is a natural thing for us in the  first place is because you need it for survival.  But we are beyond survival. We're past that.  Now we're looking for purpose and meaning and joy and you cannot find those things with  preference. You cannot find those things with ego or with they need to survive.  This is why there is no greater cause than healing other people than meditating yourself.  Because when you heal yourself and you let yourself go from division and you come into  your greater sense of unity and love and peace and harmony, you unconsciously give other people  the permission to do the same. You are like a pebble and a pond spreading ripples throughout  all of society. In a way that is not physical and a way that is so much more permanent,  so much more meaningful and genuinely, long lasting and impactful.  Anyways, that's all. Quirtimpletions number 8 out and I hope you guys are having a good one.  I'll be well.
