==================================================

I did not want to do this in any capacity. On top of just having a really long day, I forgot to turn on my AC and drink water before I started.  So I was just like in an AD degree apartment with a dry throat and I also was busy from like 10 a.m. all the way till now, which is this is recorded at 2 a.m.  But even with all that said, it was fine. And it's always fine. Every time you can always find your breath, you can always bring it back.  And that's your only job. Meditation isn't about some state that you have to.  It's not about being successful or being strong. It's about walking the path wherever you are on it.  It's not about being successful or being successful or being successful.
